It was released as the album's first single on April 28, 2008 through Capitol Records. It was written by Perry, Lukasz Gottwald, Max Martin and Cathy Dennis, with production helmed by Gottwald under his production name Dr. Luke. Perry says the song is \"about the magical beauty of a woman\". The song is a electro-rock number that runs through a throbbing beat and contains influences of New Wave.\r\n\r\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" received mixed reception for music critics upon reviewing the parent album, praising its sound and structure while highly criticizing its lyrical content. The song drew controversy for its irreverent lyrics and was notably criticized by numerous critics and singers. The song experienced commercial success domestically as well as internationally.

The single has sold over 4,155,000 digital copies in the US alone. \"I Kissed a Girl\" is one of six Perry songs to top 4 million paid downloads in the US, the others being \"Hot n Cold\", \"California Gurls\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\" and \"Teenage Dream\".

It was the first single from the group's 2007 album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace. It is one of Foo Fighters' most successful songs; only \"Learn to Fly\" and \"Best of You\" beat its position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\r\n\r\nIn a 2007 interview with XFM, frontman Dave Grohl stopped short of explaining the meaning behind \"The Pretender\", but alluded its roots go to current political unrest. Grohl noted,\r\n\"That's the thing with lyrics, you never want to give away specifics, because it's nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song. But, you know, everyone's been fucked over before and I think a lot of people feel fucked over right now and they're not getting what they were promised, and so something to do with that.\"\r\n\r\nGrohl also told XFM \"The Pretender\" was not initially planned for the album and happened really quickly.\r\n\"That song didn't happen until later on in the session. We didn't go into making the record with that song and it happened after we recorded a lot of stuff. Up until that point, I didn't know if we had a good opening song or not. So after we recorded it, I thought, 'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,' and it just became everybody's favorite song. ... It's the type of song that I look forward to opening shows with and it came together really easily. We put that song together in, I don't know, a day, whereas a lot of the other songs we worked on for weeks.\"","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/yywqts1340623131.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ","strMusicVidDirector":"Sam Brown","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"213904038","intMusicVidLikes":"876012","intMusicVidDislikes":"23236","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"57446","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"6","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"10","intTotalListeners":"1239804","intTotalPlays":"10358451","strMusicBrainzID":"ffb3f2b6-460d-4334-8221-c4912df88972","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0ce4a1f2-7908-3865-8f19-08348546424a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32731044","idAlbum":"2110303","idArtist":"111284","idLyric":"272952","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Lady","strAlbum":"Daytime Friends","strArtist":"Kenny Rogers","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"231866","strGenre":"Country","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescription":null,"strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/uwrvxv1584966953.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"18","intLoved":"6","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"6","intTotalListeners":"64883","intTotalPlays":"232839","strMusicBrainzID":"48a465ce-d211-40db-ae43-b73347ae7a66","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"2c0ab299-ab0a-3f48-be44-3d7382296d1d","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"c3d14b41-a48d-488f-bfed-ce0597bb0b1f","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32770711","idAlbum":"2114020","idArtist":"111662","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Roygbiv","strAlbum":"Music Has the Right to Children","strArtist":"Boards of Canada","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"151360","strGenre":"Ambient","strMood":"Trippy","strStyle":"Electronic","strTheme":"...","strDescription":"","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yT0gRc2c2wQ","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"3045036","intMusicVidLikes":"21161","intMusicVidDislikes":"304","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"3016","intTrackNumber":"10","intLoved":"6","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"6","intTotalListeners":"354808","intTotalPlays":"2486226","strMusicBrainzID":"2a72cd7b-f566-4c91-8e9b-7b33b95dfff7","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"17d74d52-c92b-3b8d-9f87-218ab2d1c4a0","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"69158f97-4c07-4c4e-baf8-4e4ab1ed666e","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32752554","idAlbum":"2112363","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"119758","idIMVDB":"2147483647","strTrack":"Space Oddity","strAlbum":"Space Oddity","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"316333","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":"Weird","strStyle":"Rock\/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescription":"\"Space Oddity\" is a song written and recorded by David Bowie. It was first released as a 7-inch single on 11 July 1969. It was also the opening track of his second studio album, David Bowie. It became one of Bowie's signature songs and one of four of his songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\r\n\r\nInspired by Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later and would become the first manned moon landing another five days after that. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which was and still is an unmanned project. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and possibly the music video for \"Blackstar\".\r\n\r\n\"Space Oddity\" was David Bowie's first single to chart in the UK. It reached the top five on its initial release and received the 1970 Ivor Novello Special Award for Originality. His second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song became Bowie's first UK No. 1 single.\r\n\r\nIn December 1972, Mick Rock shot a video of Bowie miming to the June 1969 recording of the song, during the sessions for Aladdin Sane. The resulting music video was used to promote the 1973 US reissue of the \"Space Oddity\" single on RCA.","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/xsqwwq1569313472.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iYYRH4apXDo","strMusicVidDirector":"Mick Rock","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"41120998","intMusicVidLikes":"343440","intMusicVidDislikes":"9495","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"22973","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"6","intScore":"9.75","intScoreVotes":"8","intTotalListeners":"704902","intTotalPlays":"4422512","strMusicBrainzID":"84649f3b-6da6-4da6-8e33-a7a990b69516","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"2e12918c-4973-3537-b9ab-e4723ae1ae1d","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33011178","idAlbum":"2133400","idArtist":"114824","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Mr. Saxobeat","strAlbum":"Saxobeats","strArtist":"Alexandra Stan","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"195000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescription":"\"Mr. Saxobeat\" is a song by Romanian recording artist Alexandra Stan from her debut studio album Saxobeats (2011). \"Mr. Saxobeat\" is an up-tempo Eurodance song with house elements.

It was written by Andrei Nemirschi and Marcel Prodan a Romanian producing-duo and produced by the latter one at the Maan Studios in Romania.

It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, Lateralus. In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song.\r\n\"Schism\" was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, dual-commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.\r\n\r\n\"Schism\" is renowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times. The song begins with two bars of 5\/4, followed by one bar of 4\/4, followed by bars of alternating 5\/8 and 7\/8, until the first interlude, which consists of alternating bars of 6\/8 and 7\/8.\r\nThe following verse exhibits a similar pattern to the first, alternating bars of 5\/8 and 7\/8. The next section is bars of 6\/4 followed by one bar of 11\/8. This takes the song back into alternating 5\/8 and 7\/8. Another 6\/8 and 7\/8 section follows, and after this the song goes into repeating 7\/8 bars.\r\nThe middle section is subsequently introduced, consisting of three bars of 6\/8, one bar of 3\/8, and one bar of 3\/4 repeating several times. At one point it interrupts with two bars of 6\/8 followed by a bar of 4\/8, twice. A bar of 5\/8 is played before the meter switches back to 6\/8 for two bars and 2\/4 for one bar. This repeats, setting up another section: two bars of 9\/8 followed by a bar of 10\/8, that pattern again, and then a single bar of 9\/8 followed by alternating bars of 6\/8 and 7\/8.

It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic.\r\nThe unexpected success of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana's biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992.\r\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result.

The song also reached #48 in the UK chart as a re-entry in 2005, showing the song's longevity. The album version is nearly nine minutes long and contains some lyrics not able to be broadcast on the radio edit due to their explicit content.

The song's title and lyrics derive from an in-joke among the band, referring to the Hindu theory of cause and effect, known as karma.\r\n\r\n\"Karma Police\" was released as the second single from OK Computer, and became a commercial success, charting at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and number fourteen on the US Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Critical reception to the single was also favourable.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 the song was featured on the Radiohead: The Best Of collection.\r\n\r\n\"Karma Police\", like several other songs that would make up OK Computer, was debuted live in 1996, when the band briefly supported Alanis Morissette on tour. A live version of \"Karma Police\", performed with a Rhodes piano on the Late Show with David Letterman, is captured in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy.\r\n\r\n\"Karma Police\" is in a 4\/4 time signature and played in standard tuning. The first half of the song is in the key of E minor, and would feature a Neapolitan chord (F). The second half (starting with the line \"For a minute there\") is in B minor. Acoustic guitar and piano are the most prominent instruments in the song, and the chord progression owes an audible debt to The Beatles song \"Sexy Sadie\".\r\n\r\nThe structure of the song is unconventional in that it has nothing resembling a typical chorus. Instead, the song progresses from the intro into a mid-tempo section which alternates between two verses. The first verse begins with the line \"Karma police\", and the other begins with the line \"This is what you'll get\". During the second section the drums drop out and an analog synthesizer imitating a choir is featured. After this section cycles through twice, the song switches into a second section which is based around the line \"For a minute there, I lost myself\". During this section of the song, Yorke's voice is put through an echo effect and a sliding melodic figure serves as a counterpoint to Yorke's vocals. In the outro, Ed O'Brien plays a few notes on his guitar, which are distorted by overloading an AMS rackmount digital delay unit and turning the delay rate knob down.\r\n\r\nRadiohead members used to tell one another that they would call \"the karma police\" on them if they did something bad. The joke was incorporated into the lyrics and title of the song. Yorke explained that the song was about stress and \"having people looking at you in that certain  way, I can't handle it anymore\". Thom Yorke explained the idea of the lyrics to The Independent in 2006, saying, \"It's for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. Fuck the middle management!\" Yorke and Jonny Greenwood emphasised in interviews that the song had a humorous bent; Yorke said, \" not entirely serious, I hope people will realize that.\" The song includes the line \"He buzzes like a fridge\/He's like a detuned radio\", a reference to the distracting, metaphorical background noise Yorke calls \"fridge buzz\". Yorke has said that the idea of fridge buzz is one of the primary themes of OK Computer. \"Karma Police\" also shares themes of insanity and dissatisfaction with capitalism.\r\n\r\nThe music video for the song was directed by Jonathan Glazer, previously responsible for Radiohead's \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" clip. The video premiered in August 1997 and featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke as well as Hungarian actor Lajos Kov\u00e1cs. Glazer won MTV's Director of the Year award in 1997 for his work on this, as well as Jamiroquai's \"Virtual Insanity\". Glazer however revealed in an interview that he considers this video to be a failed attempt. According to MTV.com, Glazer had pitched the concept of the \"Karma Police\" video months earlier to Marilyn Manson, who disliked it.\r\n\r\nThe video starts with the camera, an unseen driver, looking at the empty back seat of a 1976 Chrysler New Yorker at night. The 'driver' then faces the windscreen and begins driving. For 35 seconds, it shows nothing but a road through grass illuminated by headlights, with insects visible around the windscreen. A figure is then seen running from the car. In time for the chorus the view shifts back to the back seat, where Thom Yorke now sits, almost mumbling his lyrics. The view yet again moves to the figure, who is close to being mown down, as the view again switches to Yorke, now slouching drowsily against the back of the front seat, barely lipsyncing any longer. The camera swivels again and the figure appears again, close this time. For the first time another perspective reveals the outside of the car. The pursued figure sharpens and is revealed to be a large man with a frightened look. The car comes to a stop before him, then reverses slightly, as if for a 'run up', and this reveals it to be leaking fuel. The man realises the car has a petrol leak and puts his hands behind his back as if in resignation, then takes matches from his pocket, lights one, and throws it down. The perspective shifts to the car's interior. The car suddenly reverses, away from the man, a path of fire now blazes back towards the car. The car slowly catches fire, and the camera\/driver finally turns frantically to the back seat and robotically swivels back and forth, only to find that Yorke is no longer there.","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/qrvxpv1447964960.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1uYWYWPc9HU","strMusicVidDirector":"Jonathan Glazer","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"55350873","intMusicVidLikes":"300701","intMusicVidDislikes":"9619","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"11482","intTrackNumber":"6","intLoved":"5","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"8","intTotalListeners":"1654614","intTotalPlays":"14610151","strMusicBrainzID":"9e2ad5bc-c6f9-40d2-a36f-3122ee2072a3","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"b1392450-e666-3926-a536-22c65f834433","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"a74b1b7f-71a5-4011-9441-d0b5e4122711","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32730444","idAlbum":"2110249","idArtist":"111280","idLyric":"176287","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Dreams","strAlbum":"Rumours","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"258000","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":"Relaxed","strStyle":"Rock\/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescription":"\"Dreams\" is a song by Fleetwood Mac from their eleventh studio album Rumours (1977).

A performance of \"Dreams\" on stage was used as the promotional music video.\r\n\r\nIn the US, \"Dreams\" reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, the band's only number-one single there; it sold over a million copies. In Canada, \"Dreams\" also reached number one on the RPM Top 100 Singles chart.\r\n\r\nBackground and composition\r\nThe members of Fleetwood Mac were experiencing emotional upheavals while recording the Rumours album. Mick Fleetwood was going through a divorce. Christine McVie was separating from her husband John McVie. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their eight-year relationship. \"We had to go through this elaborate exercise of denial,\" explained Buckingham to Blender magazine, \"keeping our personal feelings in one corner of the room while trying to be professional in the other.\"\r\n\r\nNicks wrote the song in early 1976 at the Record Plant studio in Sausalito, California. \"One day when I wasn't required in the main studio,\" remembers Nicks to Blender magazine, \"I took a Fender Rhodes piano and went into another studio that was said to belong to Sly Stone, of Sly and the Family Stone. It was a black-and-red room, with a sunken pit in the middle where there was a piano, and a big black-velvet bed with Victorian drapes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sat down on the bed with my keyboard in front of me,\" continues Nicks. \"I found a drum pattern, switched my little cassette player on and wrote 'Dreams' in about 10 minutes. Right away I liked the fact that I was doing something with a dance beat, because that made it a little unusual for me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Nicks played the song to the rest of the group, \"They weren't nuts about it. But I said 'Please! Please record this song, at least try it'. Because the way I play things sometimes... you really have to listen.\" The band recorded it the following day. Only a basic track was recorded at Sausalito. Recording assistant Cris Morris remembers that \"all (they) kept was the drum track and live vocal from Stevie \u2013 the guitars and bass were added later in Los Angeles.\" Christine McVie described the song as having \"just three chords and one note in the left hand\" and \"boring\" when Nicks played a rough version on the piano. McVie changed her mind after Buckingham \"fashioned three sections out of identical chords, making each section sound completely different. He created the impression that there's a thread running through the whole thing.\"","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/6nyzyt1601801523.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"Now here you go again\r\nYou say you want your freedom\r\nWell who am I to keep you down?\r\nIt's only right that you should\r\nPlay the way you feel it\r\nBut listen carefully to the sound\r\nOf your loneliness\r\nLike a heartbeat .. drives you mad\r\nIn the stillness of remembering what you had\r\nAnd what you lost ...\r\nAnd what you had ...\r\nYou know what you lost\r\n\r\nOh Thunder only happens when it's raining\r\nPlayers only love you when they're playing\r\nThey say women they will come and they will go\r\nWhen the rain washes you clean you'll know\r\nYou'll know\r\n\r\nNow Here I go again I see the crystal vision\r\nI keep my visions to myself\r\nIt's only me who wants to\r\nWrap around your dreams and ...\r\nHave you any dreams you'd like to sell?\r\nDreams of Loneliness\r\nLike a heartbeat .. drives you mad\r\nIn the stillness of remembering what you had\r\nAnd what you lost ...\r\nWho says what you had ...\r\nOoh and what you lost\r\n\r\nThunder only happens when it's raining\r\nPlayers only love you when they're playing\r\nThey say women they will come and they will go\r\nWhen the rain washes you clean you'll know\r\n\r\nOh thunder only happens when it's raining\r\nPlayers only love you when they're playing\r\nThey say women they will come and they will go\r\nWhen the rain washes you clean you'll know\r\nYou'll know ...\r\nYou'll know ...\r\nYou will know\r\nOoo you'll know\r\n","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"5","intScore":"8.88889","intScoreVotes":"9","intTotalListeners":"662998","intTotalPlays":"4250617","strMusicBrainzID":"248cc9d1-97ea-493e-84d4-4c5ec718683b","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"416bb5e5-c7d1-3977-8fd7-7c9daf6c2be6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32823000","idAlbum":"2118223","idArtist":"112424","idLyric":"333117","idIMVDB":"2147483647","strTrack":"Billie Jean","strAlbum":"Thriller","strArtist":"Michael Jackson","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"293000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescription":"\"Billie Jean\" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer's sixth solo album, Thriller (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims to what the song's lyrics refer to. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered one of her twins. However, Jackson himself stated that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline by guitarist David Williams, and Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized.\r\n\r\nThe song became a worldwide commercial and critical success; it was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, it topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. \"Billie Jean\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\r\n\r\nAwarded numerous honors\u2014including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame\u2014the song and corresponding music video propelled Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV's racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation. Also, Jackson's Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his \"moonwalk\" also helped to popularize the song. It was also promoted through Jackson's Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson's scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, \"Billie Jean\" sealed Jackson's status as an international pop icon.\r\nJackson stated several times that \"Billie Jean\" was based on the groupies he and his brothers encountered while part of The Jackson 5. \"Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s.\" He added: \"They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\"\r\n\r\nJackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli promoted the theory that \"Billie Jean\" was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic & The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer that he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would be if they raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed the singer to the extent that he suffered nightmares.\r\n\r\nFollowing the letters, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.\r\nMichael Jackson wrote \"Billie Jean\" with his female fans in mind, and later stated that when he wrote the song, he knew it would be a success: \"A musician knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was going to be big when I was writing it.\" The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: \"The kid probably saved our lives.\"\r\n\r\nJackson faced numerous disagreements with the song's co-producer. It has been reported that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak to be part of the collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction, which was the longest one ever created at the time. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. \"I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'\" Jones later recalled. \"He said: 'But that's the jelly!''That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\" Jones also wanted to change the track's title to \"Not My Lover\", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the demo tape sounded exactly like the finished product. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted neither and the two fell out for several days.\r\n\r\nHaving resolved their differences, Jones had Jackson sing his vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube. Jackson's entire lead vocal was performed in one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout the production of the song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard. He later said of the song, \"'Billie Jean' is hot on every level. It's (sic) hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited. It's hot sonically, because the instrumentation is so minimal, you can really hear everything. It's hot melodically  lyrically  vocally. It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually.\"\r\n\r\nThe song was mixed by Bruce Swedien ninety-one times \u2014 unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien to create a drum sound that no one had ever heard before. The audio engineer was also told to add a different element: \"sonic personality\". \"What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat\" Swedien later wrote. \"The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is.\" He concluded, \"But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean' \u2014 and that I attribute to sonic personality.\"\r\n\"Billie Jean\" blends elements of post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song opens with a standard drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two bars, another standard open hi-hat enters. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment is followed by a repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson's quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which comes and goes during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.\r\n\r\nAccording to Daryl Hall, when Jackson was recording \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d Jackson approached him and admitted to lifting the bassline for \"Billie Jean\" from a Hall & Oates song (apparently referring to Hall's \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\" from the 1981 album Private Eyes): \"Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn't mind that he copied that groove.\" Hall says he told Jackson that he had lifted the bassline himself, remarking, \"it's something we all do.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Inside the Hits, the lyrics refer to the commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the fragrance of her perfume. Jackson's vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of \"Billie Jean\", the singer's vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute and is in the key of F-sharp minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby's eyes resemble Jackson's, a voice laments, \"oh no\". This is met with Jackson's signature falsetto \"hee hee\". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson's vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean's child.","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/tqqsur1418298940.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y","strMusicVidDirector":"Steve Barron","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"128634833","intMusicVidLikes":"321232","intMusicVidDislikes":"10269","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"6","intLoved":"5","intScore":"8.23077","intScoreVotes":"13","intTotalListeners":"1266742","intTotalPlays":"7692829","strMusicBrainzID":"cb052235-5107-4988-ac2f-10404025c663","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"f32fab67-77dd-3937-addc-9062e28e4c37","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"f27ec8db-af05-4f36-916e-3d57f91ecf5e","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32814312","idAlbum":"2117562","idArtist":"112317","idLyric":"340266","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)","strAlbum":"Supa Dupa Fly","strArtist":"Missy Elliott","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"251000","strGenre":"Hip-Hop","strMood":"Gritty","strStyle":"Urban\/R&B","strTheme":"...","strDescription":"\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" is a song recorded by American rapper Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott.

Written by Bieber, Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, Skrillex, and BloodPop; the song was produced by the latter two. It was released on October 22, 2015, as the second single from the album. A dancehall-pop, tropical house and moombahton song, \"Sorry\" contains in its instrumentation \"brassy horn bleats\", warm island rhythms and a dembow riddim beat. Lyrically, \"Sorry\" is a plea for a chance to apologize to a lover, with Bieber asking forgiveness and a second chance to redeem himself. Bieber has since said that the lover was Selena Gomez. \r\n\r\nCommercially, the song topped the charts of thirteen countries. It spent 7 weeks at number one on the Canadian Hot 100 and 3 weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; \"Sorry\" was replaced by third single \"Love Yourself\" on the chart dated February 13, 2016, making Bieber the 12th act in the Hot 100's history to succeed himself at number one. He also accomplished the same feat in the United Kingdom, becoming the third act ever to self-replace at the top of the UK Singles Chart.

recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012) and appearing on her international debut album, Kiss. The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on 20 September 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, \"Call Me Maybe\" is an upbeat teen pop track that draws influences from dance-pop and disco. Lyrically, the track alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a crush.\r\n\r\nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised its composition and clever lyrical content. \"Call Me Maybe\" has attained commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders & Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. After reaching the top position in Canada, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007. In the United States, the track reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Pop Songs chart. The song is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2007's \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne. With worldwide sales of over 10 million copies, \"Call Me Maybe\" is one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.\r\n\r\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member. As part of promotion for the song, the singer has performed the track on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. \"Call Me Maybe\" has been covered by several artists, including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Dan Deacon, Fun, Big Time Rush, The Chipettes, R5, Lil' Wayne, Enter Shikari, Ben Howard, Nickelback, Cody Simpson, The Saturdays, Glee and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio. It was also covered on the season premiere episode, \"The New Rachel\", of the fourth season of Glee. The song used in in other television shows, Castle, Jane by Design, Degrassi: The Next Generation, and 90210.\r\n\r\n\"Call Me Maybe\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, which will be held on 10 February 2013. On 11 December 2012, \"Call Me Maybe\" was named Song of the Year of 2012 by MTV. In its 2012 Year-End issue, Billboard Magazine ranked this song #2 in the Hot 100 Songs, Digital Songs, and Canadian Hot 100 Songs charts, in each case behind \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", by Gotye featuring Kimbra. The song was also ranked number one by the Village Voice's annual Pazz and Jop poll, which compiles the votes of music critics from all over the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2012, selling 10 million copies in that year alone, and best-selling single in iTunes Store in 2012.","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/vsspry1359183885.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic","strMusicVidDirector":"Ben Knechtel","strMusicVidCompany":"Twin Engine Films","strMusicVidScreen1":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/mvidscreen\/sxsytq1418393847.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/mvidscreen\/xpsxqq1418393854.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/mvidscreen\/srppxs1418393860.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"1251502481","intMusicVidLikes":"5748992","intMusicVidDislikes":"322472","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"591660","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.625","intScoreVotes":"8","intTotalListeners":"793480","intTotalPlays":"7573959","strMusicBrainzID":"00a6443c-6a0e-4618-9509-4476256ee313","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e7ce6cac-d26e-470c-b8a1-97ecc07354df","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"09887aa7-226e-4ecc-9a0c-02d2ae5777e1","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32789334","idAlbum":"2115556","idArtist":"111971","idLyric":"438679","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Elvis Ain't Dead","strAlbum":"Scouting for Girls","strArtist":"Scouting for Girls","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"229000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Happy","strStyle":"Britpop","strTheme":"In Love","strDescription":"\"Elvis Ain't Dead\" is a song by the British band Scouting for Girls.

Although the song wasn't as big a commercial success as their previous singles, it gained a cult following.\r\n\r\nThe song caused considerable controversy because of its allegedly misogynistic title and its video, which depicted scenes of drunken and drug-fuelled sexual excess and violence.\r\n\r\nPrior to the release of the single, Liam Howlett was presented with three remixes of the title song, one by Jonny L, one by DJ Hype and one by Slacker. Howlett chose the DJ Hype remix to be released on the single. The Jonny L remix was released through a free CD that came along with the January issue of Muzik magazine in 1998, while the Slacker remix was never officially released, although it surfaced on a rare and limited set of white labels.","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/rysxxq1362651985.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJHVX_rKBHI","strMusicVidDirector":"Jonas \u00c5kerlund","strMusicVidCompany":"Oil Factory","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"156967","intMusicVidLikes":"1688","intMusicVidDislikes":"46","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"103","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.28571","intScoreVotes":"7","intTotalListeners":"649550","intTotalPlays":"3947670","strMusicBrainzID":"3752e069-27a6-4819-99d5-11aec26d90a7","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"ac9138ce-6331-3f8d-86d7-69f13e4ab4f4","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"4a4ee089-93b1-4470-af9a-6ff575d32704","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32802755","idAlbum":"2116684","idArtist":"111766","idLyric":"165554","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Bring Me to Life","strAlbum":"Fallen","strArtist":"Evanescence","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"237293","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":"Troubled","strStyle":"Rock\/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescription":"\"Bring Me to Life\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence.

The song delivers genres from alternative metal to rap rock and gothic metal among others.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lee, \"Bring Me to Life\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist's life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, critics praising the melody of the song, Lee's vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy.\r\n\r\nFollowing the inclusion of \"Bring Me to Life\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \"Bring Me to Life\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts.\r\n\r\nThe band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \"Bring Me to Life\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying music video for \"Bring Me to Life\" was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl. After the success of the video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, St\u00f6lzl said: \"On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the  soundtrack background of the song. I did not know if I would have to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul's arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong.\"\r\n\r\nThe video begins with Amy Lee dressed in a grey nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are performing in another room as Lee awakens and makes her way to the window. Lee exits the room out of the window and proceeds to climb up the side of the building with the wind blowing her hair and nightgown until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge she was previously standing on. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/qpuspp1359577552.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3YxaaGgTQYM","strMusicVidDirector":"Philipp St\u00f6lzl","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/mvidscreen\/wvxwyr1475831591.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"612902159","intMusicVidLikes":"4216026","intMusicVidDislikes":"115763","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"197682","intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"10","intTotalListeners":"1165058","intTotalPlays":"8990329","strMusicBrainzID":"c24eb26a-04d6-4f09-9449-9bc334f78ede","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"2187d248-1a3b-35d0-a4ec-bead586ff547","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"f4a31f0a-51dd-4fa7-986d-3095c40c5ed9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32823013","idAlbum":"2118224","idArtist":"112424","idLyric":"333181","idIMVDB":"2147483647","strTrack":"Smooth Criminal","strAlbum":"Bad","strArtist":"Michael Jackson","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"258826","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescription":"\"Smooth Criminal\" is the seventh single from Michael Jackson's 1987 Bad album.

It was written by all four members of the band for their third album, X&Y. The track is built around an organ, that is accompanied by slow tempo drums, and a vocals. It was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X&Y and has reached number four in the United Kingdom Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US.\r\nBlythe Danner, the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's mother-in-law, stated in an interview in May 2012 that Chris Martin 'wrote the song Fix You for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep every time I hear it'.\r\n\"Fix You\" received positive reviews. It has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds. The song, itself, was nominated for multiple awards in the categories of Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Anthem of the Summer. The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\r\nThe guitar solo of \"Fix You\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens' home games.\r\nThe song was played live to a motionless crowd at the Steve Jobs memorial\/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, CA.\r\n\"Fix You\" covered by Boyce Avenue was used in the video \"Internet Love Story: CTFxC Wedding (Charles & Alli)\" uploaded by user charlestrippy on 22 November 2011. As of 27 April 2012 it currently has 2,330,161 views.\r\n\r\nThe music video for \"Fix You\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \"In My Place\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band's first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete. In the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \"Make Trade Fair\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same Baudot code colour scheme on the cover of X&Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King's Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin's walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song's finale. The audience sings along with the song's final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\r\n\r\nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.","strTrackThumb":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/thumb\/xwqrtp1340356523.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k4V3Mo61fJM","strMusicVidDirector":"Sophie Muller","strMusicVidCompany":"Angelo Prod","strMusicVidScreen1":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/mvidscreen\/twryxu1363710300.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/mvidscreen\/quswrs1363710650.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https:\/\/www.theaudiodb.com\/images\/media\/track\/mvidscreen\/vxtwqy1363710824.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"358113485","intMusicVidLikes":"1501260","intMusicVidDislikes":"43019","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"63022","intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.77778","intScoreVotes":"9","intTotalListeners":"1549920","intTotalPlays":"13491338","strMusicBrainzID":"20919a48-4ad5-409c-b639-8db7ca9f9e7a","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c50b180a-12c9-3153-8ba5-eac6a6537d6f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
