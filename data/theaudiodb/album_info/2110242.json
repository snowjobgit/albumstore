It was the first album released by the band after the departure of guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. He was replaced by Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, both guitar players, singers and songwriters. Fleetwood Mac thus became a six-piece band with four singer/songwriters. The album was not as successful as its predecessor, Tango in the Night, nor did it spawn any big hit singles although \"Save Me\" made the US Top 40, while \"Love Is Dangerous\" and \"Skies the Limit\" enjoyed some airplay. Though it barely reached the US Top 20, the album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and achieved platinum status there.\nThe cover for the album was created by photographer, Dave Gorton. He stated that the band did not wish to appear on the front cover of the album and Fleetwood himself suggested that he create an image that spiritually symbolised the band instead."}]}
