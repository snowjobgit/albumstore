Produced by longtime collaborator Paul Staveley O'Duffy, the album was first released in Japan in 2001, with a European and American release the following year.\n\nSince the group's second album, 1989's Kaleidoscope World, the group has consisted of Corinne Drewery on lead vocals and multi-instrumentalist Andy Connell. On this album, Connell provides keyboards, synthesizer, guitar and accordion. Other contributing musicians on the album include Tim Cansfield (guitar), Nigel Hitchcock (tenor saxophone), Noel Langley (trumpet and fluegelhorn), and Jody Linscott (percussion). In addition to Connell, other backing vocalists include Beverley Skeete, Dee Lewis, Gina Foster and Stephanie de Sykes.\n\nAllmusic gave Somewhere Deep in the Night four stars out of a possible five, stating that the album \"is a very strong album from the duo, packed full of sweeping, melancholy tunes\". Reviewer Nick Dedina continues by describing how the album \"...uses its sumptuous, melodramatic arrangements to sugar rather bleak songs of confusion and lost love...rather than simply dazzle the listener with retro-schmaltz.\""}]}
