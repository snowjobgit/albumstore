It was Bowie's first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Hunky Dory has been described by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as having \"a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic m√©lange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class.\"\n\nThe style of the album cover was influenced by a Marlene Dietrich photo book that Bowie took with him to the photo shoot."}]}
