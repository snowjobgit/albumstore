The album marks the first appearance of drummer Taylor Hawkins, and is often seen as a departure from the band's previous work, showcasing a softer, more experimental sound. In a 2006 interview, Dave Grohl states that the album is \"totally based on melody\" and that it \"might be his favorite album that they've ever done.\"\nEarly pressings of the disc included a temporary tattoo, similar to the one featured on the album cover. The album was also re-released in 2001 in Australia as a two-CD edition which offers a second VCD disc of four videos and one bonus track, \"Fraternity.\" This Australian edition has a picture of the Australian swimmer Michael Klim on the front, wearing the temporary \"FF\" tattoo on his shoulder. The album is widely available as an enhanced CD.\n\nThere Is Nothing Left to Lose won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2001, marking the group's first ever Grammy Award. The band would go on to win the Grammy for Best Rock Album for three of their next four studio releases, (One By One, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, and Wasting Light)."}]}
