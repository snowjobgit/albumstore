Recording the album was, according to Harket, “A rather dark and heavy period for the band”, although Magne has said, “I dig Memorial Beach, and 'Dark is the Night for All' is the high point, the best thing on the disc.”\nMemorial Beach featured three more top 50 singles for the band in the UK, “Move to Memphis,” “Dark is the Night” and “Angel in the Snow”. While the album did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100, and would be the band's last to be released in the U.S., the single \"Dark Is the Night\" peaked at #11 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, their last U.S. charting to date.\nJD and Jevetta Steele from the American gospel group The Steeles appears on backing vocals on the songs \"Move to Memphis\" and \"Lie Down in Darkness\" as does the singer Kathy Wilson.\nFrench actress Béatrice Dalle appears in the music video for the song \"Move to Memphis\"\nSome lyrics from \"Locust\" were reused on the 2004 Savoy single \"Whalebone\".\nBritish indie band Memorial Beach named themselves after the album."}]}
