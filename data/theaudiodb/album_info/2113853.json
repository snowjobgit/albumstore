As the international alternative to the Walmart and Sam's Club exclusive My Worlds Acoustic (2010), My Worlds: The Collection was released in numerous European countries on November 19, 2010. The album consists of two discs; the first is a slightly altered version of My Worlds Acoustic, and the second is My Worlds, a compilation itself made up of My World (2009) and My World 2.0 (2010). In addition, the album also features a new song, an inspirational ballad entitled \"Pray\", a Jaden Smith collaboration, \"Never Say Never\", and remixes of \"Somebody to Love.\" The new versions of the songs were produced by Bieber's music director, Dan Kanter, his vocal producer Kuk Harrell, and also producer Rob Wells. While most reviewers complimented the set, several thought that its release was unneeded. The album charted moderately in Europe, reaching the top half of several album charts."}]}
