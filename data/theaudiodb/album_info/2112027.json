The album explores genres experimental for Radiohead, as the band replaced their \"anthemic\" rock style with sounds influenced by electronic music, 20th century classical music jazz and krautrock. A commercial success worldwide, Kid A went platinum in its first week of release in the United Kingdom. Despite the lack of an official single or music video as publicity, Kid A became the first Radiohead release to debut at number one in the United States. This success was credited variously to a unique marketing campaign, the early Internet leak of the album, and anticipation after the band's 1997 album, OK Computer.\n\nThough the new musical direction alienated some fans and critics, Kid A received acclaim from notable music publications, and was praised for introducing rock listeners to diverse forms of underground music. In 2009, it was named the best album of the 2000s in several rankings such as Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and The Times, and was ranked #67 in the updated version of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Kid A is now strongly recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. It won a Grammy for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year."}]}
