It peaked at number five in the United Kingdom and number 75 in the United States on the Billboard Music Charts.\n\nThe album tells the story of Bowie's alter-ego Ziggy Stardust, an alien who visits Earth in the form of a rock star. Bowie created Ziggy Stardust while in New York City promoting Hunky Dory and performed as him on a tour of the United Kingdom, Japan and North America. The album, and the character of Ziggy Stardust, was known for its glam rock influences and themes of sexual exploration and social commentary. It has been consistently considered as one of the greatest albums of all time, with Rolling Stone ranking the record the 35th greatest ever. It was ranked the 20th greatest album ever in a 1997 British survey, the 24th greatest of all time by Q magazine and one of the 100 greatest releases ever by Time magazine.\n\nA concert film of the same name directed by D.A. Pennebaker was released in 1973."}]}
