It is a double album, with one disk containing heavy rock songs and a second disk with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded on a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics dealt with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election.\n\nThe promotional tour for the album included both rock shows on stadiums and acoustic gigs on smaller venues. Reviews for In Your Honor were mostly positive, praising the composition and sound, although some critics found the album overly long and inconsistent. The album was also nominated for five Grammy Awards, and topped the charts in five countries - including Australia - and reached the top five in five more, including a number two on both the United States and the United Kingdom."}]}
