Following the departure of Würzel (Michael Burston) in 1995, the band returned to the same three-man \"classic Motörhead line up\"; bass guitar/vocals, lead guitar, and drums. In a rare outside songwriter credit, Swedish Erotica guitarist Magnus Axx contributed to writing the song \"Civil War\". This album was also the first since Ace of Spades (1980) to have a picture of the band on the cover."}]}
