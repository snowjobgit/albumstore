The album was released on August 4, 1972, while Jackson was still a member of The Jackson 5. The album received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Ben was more successful on music charts than Jackson's previous studio album, having charted within the top ten on the Billboard 200. Internationally, the album was less successful, peaking at number twelve in Canada, while charting within the top 200 positions in Australia and France.\nWorldwide, Ben has sold a reported 5 million units. The album released one single, the title track \"Ben\", which was a commercial success on music charts, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Jackson his first number one single on the chart. \"Ben\" also charted within the top ten in other territories worldwide. \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was planned to be released as the second single from the album, but canceled for unspecified reasons. Two of the album's songs were \"stripped\" in 2009 as part of the three-disc compilation Hello World: The Motown Solo Collection."}]}
