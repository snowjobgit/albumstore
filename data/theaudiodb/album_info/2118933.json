It is their last album with the GWR label, and the first appearance of their four-piece line up of Lemmy, Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, Würzel and Phil Campbell, which lasted from 1987 until 1992. Reaching only 34 in the UK charts, it was, in that respect, the worst performing of all of Motörhead's Top 40 chart hits."}]}
