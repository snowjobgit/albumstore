This all-blues album was broadly similar to their debut album, albeit with some changes to personnel and recording method. The album was recorded live in the studio with miked amplifiers and PA system, rather than plugged into the board.[citation needed] A horn section was introduced; and Christine Perfect of Chicken Shack was featured on keyboards.\nAn expanded version of this album was included in the box set, The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions."}]}
