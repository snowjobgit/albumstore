Ahh! is the second studio album by American glam metal band Poison, released in 1988 through Enigma Records. Having ultimately sold eight million copies worldwide[citation needed], it proved to be the band's most successful release, and spawned four hit singles: \"Nothin' but a Good Time\", \"Your Mama Don't Dance\" (a Loggins and Messina cover), \"Fallen Angel\" and their only #1 single to date, \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\". The album is widely considered a classic in the glam metal genre. It peaked at #2 on the US Billboard 200, being denied the top spot by Bon Jovi's massively popular New Jersey album, Guns N' Roses' debut record, Appetite for Destruction and Def Leppard's most successful album, Hysteria.\n\nOpen Up And Say Ahh was certified platinum in 1988 and 5x platinum in 1991 by the RIAA. It also has been certified 4x platinum in Canada and gold by the BPI."}]}
