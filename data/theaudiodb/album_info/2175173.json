It was released in Canada in October, 1992, and in the United States in January, 1993, on Geffen Records. Like their first release, the Peppermint EP, it was seen as a noisy pop record reminiscent of Sonic Youth with Beatles-style harmonies. Jennifer Pierce of fellow Halifax, Nova Scotia band Jale sang backup vocals on \"I Am the Cancer\". The album was certified Gold in Canada on July 12, 1995."}]}
