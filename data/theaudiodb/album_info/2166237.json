Tomorrow's Harvest's announcement was preceded by a cryptic advertising campaign beginning on Record Store Day 2013. The campaign revealed information about the upcoming release through the distribution of six strings of six-digit numbers. Four of the six codes were released to BBC Radio 1, NPR, Adult Swim and the fansite Twoism; another was released through an unannounced 12\" single, \"------ / ------ / ------ / XXXXXX / ------ / ------\", which contained a brief snippet of music and the code; and a sixth code was featured in a YouTube video. Upon the launch of a new Boards of Canada web site, Cosecha Transmisiones (Spanish for \"Harvest Transmissions\"), the combined codes were used as a password to allow users access to an exclusive video and link to pre-order the Tomorrow's Harvest.\nOn 23 May 2013, \"Reach for the Dead\" was premiered on Zane Lowe's show on BBC Radio 1 and released as Tomorrow's Harvest's lead single. On 3 June, Boards of Canada premiered the album through a live stream on YouTube, which caused the band's official web site to crash due to \"phenomenal demand.\" In Ireland, on June 7, Tomorrow's Harvest will be broadcast in full in four independent records stores and twenty-six stores in the United Kingdom on June 10, in celebration of the album's release."}]}
