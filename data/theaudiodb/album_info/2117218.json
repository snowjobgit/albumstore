This album featured stronger jazz leanings than some of their early pop-oriented albums, and is restrained in mood. For this record, SOS adapted to the growing popularity of hip-hop in the late '90s.\n\nFilth and Dreams is the first album by the group not released in their native England, and is currently the most difficult CD to find."}]}
