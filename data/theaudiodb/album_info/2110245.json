This album featured a unique line-up for the band featuring the addition of former Traffic guitarist Dave Mason and country vocalist Bekka Bramlett, daughter of Delaney and Bonnie, to the line-up. It is the first and only Fleetwood Mac album since 1974's Heroes Are Hard To Find to feature neither Stevie Nicks nor Lindsey Buckingham as full band members. This album was also the first that failed to make the charts in the US. The band undertook a worldwide tour in support of the album from July to the end of December 1994, and again from April to September 1995.\n\nWithin a year this line-up had collapsed with Mason, Bramlett and Billy Burnette all leaving the band, but Bramlett and Burnette recorded the Bekka & Billy album together in 1997, the same year Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks rejoined Fleetwood Mac."}]}
