It was the first Fleetwood Mac album since Kiln House in 1970 that did not include tracks written by vocalist/keyboardist Christine McVie, who had left the group in 1998. McVie is featured on three songs, which had been originally recorded for an unreleased Lindsey Buckingham solo album (tracks 2, 13 & 14). It also marks the first studio album in 16 years to feature Buckingham as a full member.\nSay You Will was the first Fleetwood Mac studio album to peak in the top 3 in the US since 1982's Mirage. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in July 2003 for 500,000 copies shipped in the US. It has also been certified Gold in the UK for 100,000 copies shipped.\nA limited-edition version of this disc was issued at the same time, featuring two live tracks (\"Peacekeeper\" and \"Say You Will\"), two additional studio tracks (Nicks' \"Not Make Believe\" and Buckingham's cover of Bob Dylan's \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\"), an expanded booklet and poster.\nNicks would later express her dislike for many of the songs on the album, claiming that the recording, production and subsequent tour were all very difficult to get through, mostly due to the then still-strained relationship between her and Buckingham. Scenes of this are present on the 'making of' DVD documentary \"Destiny Rules\"."}]}
