This is their last album to feature Danny Kirwan, who was fired during the album's supporting tour. In the wake of the band's success in the mid-70s, Bare Trees earned Gold status in 1976.\nThe album features the original version of \"Sentimental Lady\", which was later re-recorded by its composer Bob Welch (with Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, and Lindsey Buckingham backing him) for his solo album French Kiss. \"Spare Me a Little of Your Love\" became a staple of the band's live act from 1972-77.\n\"Trinity\", a Danny Kirwan song, was an outtake from the album that was subsequently released in 1992 on the 25 Years - The Chain box set.\nThe lyrics for Kirwan's composition \"Dust\" were taken from a poem by Rupert Brooke.\n\"Thoughts on a Grey Day\" is a poem read by an elderly woman, Mrs Scarrott, who lived near the band's communal home in southern England."}]}
