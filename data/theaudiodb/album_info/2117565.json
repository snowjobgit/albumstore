The album is notable for the fact that Timbaland, who produced the vast majority of material on Elliott's past albums, only produced two tracks.\nThree singles were released from the album; the first, \"Lose Control\", was released on May 27, 2005, and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and charted well internationally. The second single, \"Teary Eyed\", was released on August 8, 2005, and failed to chart on any Billboard chart and charted low in other countries. The third single, \"We Run This\", was released on February 21, 2006, and peaked at number forty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted moderately well internationally.\nThe album received generally favorable reviews from critics and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling 645,000 copies in the United States and received a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album, ultimately losing to Kanye West's Late Registration. The music video for Lose Control, directed by Dave Meyers won the Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video."}]}
