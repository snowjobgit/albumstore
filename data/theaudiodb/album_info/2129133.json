A reaction to the abrasiveness of alternative rock in the early 1990s —when grunge had a reigning popularity—, Low \"eschewed conventional songwriting in favour of mood and movement.\" Influenced by Brian Eno and Joy Division, the band favored slow-paced compositions, a minimum of instrumentation and an economy of language; working with long-time producer and New York underground mainstay Mark Kramer. Featuring an \"unprecedent pace in the then-flowering underground,\" I Could Live in Hope help to birth the genre known as slowcore, that encompassed acts from Bedhead to Codeine throughout the 1990s."}]}
