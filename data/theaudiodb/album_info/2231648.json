It is the follow-up to 2009's Invaders Must Die and is to be released on 30 March 2015. The album will be released by Three Six Zero Music/Warner Bros. Records in the United States.\n\nThe first single, \"Nasty\", was announced on the band's Instagram and Facebook pages on 29 December 2014. The album title is a reference to the Cole Porter song \"All Through the Night\", in particular its lyrics \"the day is my enemy, the night my friend\", although it is the Ella Fitzgerald version that first inspired the title track. On the 26th of January 2015 the band released the official audio for the title track \"The Day Is My Enemy\" on their official YouTube channel."}]}
