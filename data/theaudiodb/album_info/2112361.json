Written and recorded in Switzerland, Bowie regarded the album at the time as a \"move back to rock 'n roll music. Very directly.\" The album was certified Gold by RIAA in early July 1987, less than 3 months after the release date.\n\nBowie described the tracks from Never Let Me Down as being written for being performed on stage and they formed the backbone of his highly theatrical Glass Spider world tour in 1987 (the official video album from the tour was also called Glass Spider).\n\nWhen the album was released, Bowie thought he'd go back into the studio to record more material, stating, \"We're all very excited to be going back in the studio. We over-wrote on [this] album and I think there's a lot more new material we want to record.\" But in fact Bowie's next solo album didn't arrive until Black Tie White Noise in 1993."}]}
