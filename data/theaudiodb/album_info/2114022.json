Released by Warp Records in October 2005, the album featured the addition of heavily treated acoustic guitars and the use of more conventional song structures. The album took the duo three years to make.\n“\tWe usually imagine our music to have a visual element while we're writing it, so we were picturing this character losing his mind at the campfire and compressing weeks of events into a few hours, in that time-stretching way that acid fucks with your perception.\n– Michael Sandison"}]}
