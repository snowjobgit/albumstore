It is scheduled for release on November 13, 2015, by Def Jam Recordings. The album was preceded by the release of the lead single \"What Do You Mean?\" on August 28, 2015. \"Sorry\" was released as the second single from the album on October 23, 2015. The album serves as the follow-up to Bieber's fourth studio album Journals (2013).\nBieber debuted the track \"What Do You Mean?\", during the MTV Video Music Awards on August 30, 2015. This was followed by a number of other televised performances, including The X Factor, The Today Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and the 2015's Think it Up telecast. On October 16, 2015, Purpose was made available to pre-order. A remixed version of \"What Do You Mean?\" with additional vocals from Ariana Grande will be made available to those who pre-order the album on iTunes.\n\nPurpose was initially banned in various Middle Eastern countries and Indonesia due to the cover art's heavy Christian references, most prominently Bieber's cross tattoo and his praying stance, which were deemed \"too provocative\". An alternate cover was issued for these countries, depicting Bieber atop a cliff, looking out over a shore.\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Bieber announced the album track listing through a series of tweets that displayed each title graffitied on a wall in various countries.\n\nBieber announced the first leg of his world tour on November 11, 2015."}]}
