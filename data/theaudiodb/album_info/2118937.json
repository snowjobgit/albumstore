It was released on February 26, 1991 on WTG Records.\n916 was Motörhead's first studio album in nearly four years, and their first release on WTG after their legal battle with GWR Records was resolved. In the album's liner notes, the band says \"...to the people we left behind - we didn't want to leave ya, but we really had to go! This album is the better for it. Stale and on a treadmill in our career, a change was needed.\" Some of the songs (including \"The One to Sing the Blues\", \"I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care)\", \"No Voices in the Sky\" and \"Going to Brazil\") were originally performed live on Motörhead's 1989 and 1990 tours."}]}
