It was produced by Nigel Godrich and released on June 5, 2001 through Parlophone. Recorded in the same sessions as previous album Kid A (2000), Amnesiac incorporates similar influences of electronic music, classical music, jazz and krautrock, and explores themes of memory and reincarnation influenced by ancient Greek and Egyptian mythology. Singer Thom Yorke described the album as \"another take on Kid A, a form of explanation.\"\n\nAmnesiac produced three singles: \"Pyramid Song\", \"I Might Be Wrong\" and \"Knives Out\". It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number two on the US Billboard 200, and received positive reviews from music critics, though many considered it inferior to its sister album Kid A. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 320 in their updated version of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."}]}
