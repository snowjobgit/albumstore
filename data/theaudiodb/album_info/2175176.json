It was released on Murderecords in 2001, and is often seen as the band's most mature album. While it still has the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1990s influences of Between the Bridges, it is more melancholy with fewer of the upbeat songs found on previous albums. 'If It Feels Good Do It' and 'The Other Man' were the two major singles from the album, with the latter being a melancholy plea by Chris Murphy which marked an outing from the usual upbeat songs Murphy provides the group with. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2002 Juno Awards."}]}
