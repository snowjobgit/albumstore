It was their only album to feature drummer Faust and one-time bassist Tchort. Considered a landmark in the black metal scene, the album has been ranked by critics as one of the most influential albums of the genre. It also contains some of Emperor's best known tracks, \"I Am the Black Wizards\" and \"Inno a Satana\". \nThe album cover was drawn by Kristian Wåhlin, also known as \"Necrolord\", depicting a host of orcs en route to Minas Morgul. The part below the band logo is based upon a section of a larger engraving called \"Death on a Pale Horse (Revelation)\" by Gustave Doré. That section itself was also used as the album cover for the Emperor (EP)."}]}
