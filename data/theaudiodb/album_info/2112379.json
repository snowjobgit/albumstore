Widely regarded as one of his most influential releases, Low was the first of the \"Berlin Trilogy\", a series of collaborations with Brian Eno (though the album was mainly recorded in France and only mixed in West Berlin). The experimental, avant-garde style would be further explored on Heroes and Lodger. The album's working title was New Music Night and Day."}]}
