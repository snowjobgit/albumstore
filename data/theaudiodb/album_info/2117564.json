The album is noted for adding a raunchier and darker style to Missy's music, as well as the repetitive usage of \"bitch\" in a majority of her songs. The album also featured a comeback by female rapper, Lil' Kim, who was on hiatus for a short period of time, due to the death of Notorious B.I.G.; the album also added a bit of controversy when Elliott's former protégé Danja Mowf was cut from the album and replaced by Redman on the track, \"Dangerous Mouths\". The album includes the singles \"She's a Bitch\", \"All N My Grill\", and \"Hot Boyz [Remix]\", and includes guest appearances by Timbaland, B.G., Juvenile, Lil' Mo, Nicole, Beyoncé, Eminem, Gina Thompson, Lady Saw, Da Brat, Aaliyah, Big Boi of OutKast, Lil' Kim, MC Solaar & Redman."}]}
