It was released on 25 April 2018 in digital and physical formats by Alexandra Stan Records and Victor Entertainment. Stan collaborated with producers from multiple countries, including Marius Mirică, Alex Parker, Laurențiu Popescu, Simon Says, Cristian Ștefănescu and Cristian Tarcea. She recorded Mami in Los Angeles, United States, where she relocated with her boyfriend in September 2017. The singer was involved in the writing process of several songs featured on the album. \nMusic critic Jonathan Currinn of website CelebMix gave Mami a mixed review. While picking several tracks as highlights and praising the contributions of the featured artists on the album, he criticized selected songs as \"rushed\" and unfinished. Musically, Mami has been described as a Latin-inspired dance-pop album; according to Stan, influences include pop, reggae and Balkan music. The singer also said that the album’s title represents her femininity and artistic maturity. Mami was preceded by the release of three singles, \"Boy Oh Boy\" (2017), \"Noi doi\" (2017) and \"Mami\" (2018), to minor success in Lithuania and Romania, as well as the promotional single \"Favorite Game\". The album itself reached number 119 on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart. Stan promoted it with live appearances in Japan, as well in Europe and Canada."}]}
