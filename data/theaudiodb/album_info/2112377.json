His nineteenth studio album, it has been called \"risky\" but successful. The album was Bowie's \"highly anticipated\" reunion with Brian Eno, whom Bowie had worked with most famously on his Berlin Trilogy. Subtitled \"the Ritual Art-Murder of Baby Grace Blue: A non-linear Gothic Drama Hyper-Cycle,\" Outside centres around the characters of a dystopian world on the eve of the 21st century. The album put Bowie back into the mainstream scene of rock music with its singles \"The Hearts Filthy Lesson\", \"Strangers When We Meet\", and \"Hallo Spaceboy\" (notably remixed by Pet Shop Boys)."}]}
