It was his last studio album with the bulk of 'The Spiders from Mars', his backing band throughout his Ziggy Stardust phase; Mick Woodmansey was replaced on drums by Aynsley Dunbar.\n\nPin Ups entered the UK chart on 3 November 1973 (coincidentally the same day as Bryan Ferry's covers album These Foolish Things) and stayed there for 21 weeks, peaking at #1. It re-entered the chart on 30 April 1983, this time for fifteen weeks, peaking at #57. In July 1990, it again entered the chart, for one week, at #52.\n\nA version of The Velvet Underground's \"White Light/White Heat\" was recorded during the sessions. It was never released; Bowie donated the backing track to Mick Ronson for his 1975 album Play Don't Worry.\n\nThe woman on the cover with Bowie is 1960s supermodel Twiggy in a photograph taken by her then-manager Justin de Villeneuve."}]}
