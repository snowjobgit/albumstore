This is the first of the post-Peter Green Fleetwood Mac albums, and their last album to feature Jeremy Spencer. Christine McVie was present at the recording sessions and contributed backing vocals and cover art, although she was not a full member of the band until shortly after the album's completion.\nSpencer's retro 50s homages and parodies dominate the album, but Danny Kirwan's more sincere songs are almost equally prominent. \"Buddy's Song\" is credited to Buddy Holly's mother, but is basically the song \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" with new lyrics listing a number of Buddy Holly song titles.\nAn early version of Kirwan's instrumental \"Earl Gray\", entitled \"Farewell\", was later released on the compilation The Vaudeville Years."}]}
