The album is the first to feature guitarist Chris Shiflett. Production on the album was troubled, with initial recording sessions considered unsatisfying and raising tensions between the band members. They eventually decided to redo the album from scratch during a two week period at frontman Dave Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, Virginia. The songs on the album, which include the successful singles \"All My Life\" and \"Times Like These\", have been noted for their introspective lyrics and a heavier and more aggressive sound compared to the band's earlier work, which Grohl said was intended to translate the energy of the Foo Fighters' live performances into a recording.\n\nThe album was a commercial success, topping the charts in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom and sold over one million copies in the United States. One by One was positively received by critics, winning a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2004 and praised for its sound and production. However, some considered the work inferior to the band's previous albums, and the musicians themselves eventually grew distasteful of the record as a whole."}]}
