After rumours that they had broken up following the problems they faced with Geffen Records when Twice Removed was released, Sloan began touring and writing again in 1995 and released One Chord to Another on Murderecords in 1996. Like the previous album it was a catchy, Beatles-influenced pop record. The band also experimented with instruments they had never used before, such as trumpets and maracas."}]}
