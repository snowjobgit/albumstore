It was released in 1989 and features the singles \"Where In The World?\" (UK #47), \"You On My Mind\" (a UK #28 hit), \"Forever Blue\" (UK #80), and \"Waiting Game\". With the addition of an orchestra, this album featured a more sophisticated, easy listening/retro sound than their previous synth-oriented debut album, 1987's It's Better to Travel. The album reached #9 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe album was notable for being released on the newly reactivated Polygram subsidiary label Fontana Records, which had been a highly successful record label in the 1960s (something reflected in the stylised cover art for Kaleidoscope World). The album also features solos from the veteran harmonica player Tommy Reilly. Original band member Martin Jackson left Swing Out Sister during the making of this album. Although the liner notes give \"special thanks to Martin Jackson\" and his co-writing credits appear on the songs \"Tainted\" and \"Between Strangers\", they also point out that \"Swing Out Sister are Corinne Drewery and Andy Connell.\" Jimmy Webb arranged and conducted the orchestra for \"Forever Blue\" and \"Precious Words.\""}]}
