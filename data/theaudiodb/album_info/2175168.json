It was released on Geffen Records in 1994, and is considered to be one of their best albums. It was more melodic and catchy than their previous album, Smeared, and as a result Geffen did not promote it very well because it didn't fit the commercially dominant grunge rock style of the time. The band was dropped from Geffen after Twice Removed was released. Although it was the record that made them famous in Canada, Sloan took time off from touring and writing after the troubles with Geffen, and they were rumoured to have broken up. The album was certified Gold in Canada on October 20, 1998."}]}
