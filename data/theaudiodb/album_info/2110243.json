It was their first album with American guitarist Bob Welch and the first to feature Christine McVie as a full member. Without the 1950s leanings of departed guitarist Jeremy Spencer, the band moved further away from blues and closer to the melodic pop sound that would finally break them in America four years later. After the band completed the album and turned it in, the record label said that it would not release an album with only seven songs, and demanded that they record an eighth. \"What a Shame\" was recorded hastily as a jam to fulfill this request.\nA heavily edited version of \"Sands of Time\" was an unsuccessful single in the United States and some other territories. However, the album did get airplay on FM radio. The title track \"Future Games\" was later re-recorded by Bob Welch for his 1979 solo album The Other One.\nThere is an early version of \"Morning Rain\" with the title \"Start Again\", as recorded in a BBC session on 5 January 1971."}]}
