It was released on 8 July 1997 through Candlelight Records and Century Black. \nThe album was recorded in the Grieg Hall in Bergen, Norway.\nThe opening guitar riff to \"Ye Entrancemperium\" is taken from an unnamed Mayhem song. As such, Mayhem guitarist Euronymous is credited in the album liner notes, even though he was murdered three years before the album was written and recorded. A recording of this unfinished track can be found on the Mayhem bootleg Ha Elm Zalag."}]}
