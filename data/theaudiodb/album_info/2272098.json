Credited with bringing about the birth of Oi!, Sparrer did it first and best...tracks like \"Where Are They Now\" and \"England Belongs to Me\" rate as first-class among any punk, past or present. This is a fairly decent place to start if your a new fan, or, if you're like me, a good cd to play whenever vinyl isn't handy...Pick this up, and listen to part of history, then start a band and create your own history. Also, pick up \"Shock Troops\", possibly the greatest punk album EVER."}]}
