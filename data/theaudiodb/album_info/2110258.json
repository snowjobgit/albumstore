This was their last album to feature Bob Weston. Most of the songs were penned by guitarist/singer Bob Welch and keyboardist/singer Christine McVie, who were playing a major role in edging the band's sound towards the radio-friendly pop/rock that would make them highly successful a few years later. Although the album only sold moderately and produced no hit singles, \"Hypnotized\" did become an FM radio staple for many years. In the wake of the Buckingham Nicks lineup's success a few years later, it achieved Gold status in 1976."}]}
