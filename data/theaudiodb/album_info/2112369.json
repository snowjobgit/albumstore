The title track of the album became one of Bowie's biggest hit singles, reaching number 1 in the UK, the US and various other countries. Further singles included \"Modern Love\" and \"China Girl\", which both reached number 2 in the UK. \"China Girl\" was a new version of a song which Bowie had co-written with Iggy Pop for the latter's 1977 album The Idiot. The album also contains a rerecorded version of the song \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" which had been a minor hit for Bowie a year earlier. Let's Dance is also notable as a stepping stone for the career of the Texas blues guitar virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughan, who played on it. The album was also released as a limited edition picture disc in 1983. Let's Dance has sold 6 million copies worldwide, making it Bowie's best-selling album."}]}
