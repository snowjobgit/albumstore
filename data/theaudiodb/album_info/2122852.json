It was released on 19 June 2009 and reached No. 1 on the German Album Chart and No. 2 on the Norwegian Album Chart. In its first week in the UK, the album debuted at No. 5, their highest chart placing in that country since Stay on These Roads in 1988.\nThe overall sound of the record marks a return to the synthpop style the band became famous for in the mid-1980s. Keyboardist Magne Furuholmen describes the album thus: \"It's an album that incorporates the key elements that first defined the band: soaring vocals, synth hooks, yearning lyrics and melodic melancholia.\"\nFoot of the Mountain was A-ha's last full length album before their split in 2010. However, they did release a further compilation album \"25\" with their last single \"Butterfly, Butterfly (The Last Hurrah)\")."}]}
