It contains the European hit singles \"Darling\" and \"Parlez-Vous Fran√ßais?\", their entry for the 1978 Eurovision Song Contest. Baccara represented Luxembourg, performed their song in French and although they undoubtedly were the biggest stars participating in that year's contest they surprisingly only finished in 7th place.\n\nThe rights to the RCA-Victor back catalogue are currently held by Sony BMG Music Entertainment - the original Light My Fire album in its entirety remains unreleased on compact disc."}]}
