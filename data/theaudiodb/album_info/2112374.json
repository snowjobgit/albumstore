It was Bowie's final studio album for the label and his first following the so-called Berlin Trilogy of Low, \"Heroes\" and Lodger (1977–1979). Though considered significant in artistic terms, the trilogy had proved less successful commercially. With Scary Monsters, however, Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley called \"the perfect balance\": as well as earning critical acclaim, the album peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom and restored Bowie's commercial standing in the United States."}]}
