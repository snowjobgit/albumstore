'The Beautiful Game' was the beginning of a new direction for Acoustic Alchemy with expanded musical horizons. 'AArt' continues the metamorphosis to a brilliant climax. Devotees will appreciate the classic AA sound in tunes like \"Cactus Blue\", \"The Wind of Change\" and \"Tuff Puzzle\", melodic pieces driven by Carmichael's nylon strings and his guitar partner Miles Gilderdale's steels.\n\nBut perhaps some of the most dazzling music on 'Aart' is in the more jazzy pieces, most notably \"Wish You Were Near\", \"Aart Attack\", and \"Robbie's Revenge\". A new sound for AA emerges in these tracks, a sonorous interplay between the twin guitars and a full-frontal horn section, with the likes of Jeff Kashiwa on sax. The new sound is full and fresh, while staying true to Acoustic Alchemy's roots. \"Flamoco Loco\" is a tongue-in-cheek look at the Latin sound which was so much a part of the band's early days, while \"The Velvet Swing\" shows a new maturity and passion in the group's songwriting.\n\nLong time fans will find something familiar to hold on to with 'Aart'; the spirit of Nick Webb lives on in the group. New fans, however, will find that Acoustic Alchemy definitely has something to offer with a more rounded sound and melodies that keep you spinning the disc. Whichever catagory you fall into, you won't be disappointed."}]}
