In high school, Elliott and three friends formed a group called Fayze, later renamed Sista. The group caught the attention of record producer DeVante Swing, who was part of the R&B group Jodeci, who signed them to his record label, Swing Mob. The group recorded an album in New York, which was never released. This led to the termination of the group's recording contract. After returning Portsmouth, Virginia, Elliott and record producer Timbaland began writing songs, contributing several to singer Aaliyah's album, One in a Million.\n\nIn 1996, Elliott was signed to Elektra Records and was given her own record label, Gold Mind. Chairmen and chief executive officer (CEO) of Elektra at the time, Sylvia Rhone encouraged Elliott to embark in a solo career. Supa Dupa Fly was recorded and produced solely by Timbaland, and was released in July 1997 through The Goldmind Inc. and Elektra Records. The album features the singles, \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\", \"Sock It 2 Me\", \"Hit Em wit da Hee\" and \"Beep Me 911\". Guest appearances on the album include Busta Rhymes, Ginuwine, Nicole Wray and Aaliyah. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and topped the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It sold 1.2 million copies in the United States, where it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America."}]}
