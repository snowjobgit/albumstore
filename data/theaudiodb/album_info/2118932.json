It is considered the band's first album, as the recordings they did with United Artists were shelved until 1979, when the band had some commercial success after their next two albums.\n\nThis would be the first album with the 'classic' line up of Kilmister, Clarke, Taylor – their only release under Chiswick – as due to the success of this album they were signed to Bronze Records by early 1978"}]}
