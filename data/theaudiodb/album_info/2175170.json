Released on Murderecords in 1998, the album is slightly heavier than their previous albums, showing an influence from 1970s rock mixed with their usual catchy, melodic, Beatles-esque sound. The album contains arguably their most popular song, \"Money City Maniacs\". \"Money City Maniacs\" was used in a beer commercial at the time; furthermore, it became a top 10 hit in their native Canada and received heavy radio airplay. The album was certified Gold in Canada on June 12, 1998. Navy Blues was also nominated for Best Rock Album at the 1999 Juno Awards."}]}
