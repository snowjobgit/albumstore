The result was a combination of old and new sounds, with guitarist C. C. DeVille frequently preferring pop and punk rock sounds to the heavy metal style which had characterized Poison's previous records. The band's new style was particularly evident in the songs \"Emperor's New Clothes\", \"Livin' In the Now\" and \"Home (C.C's Story)\" which featured DeVille on lead vocals."}]}
