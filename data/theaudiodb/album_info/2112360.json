It was originally released on Mercury Records in November 1970 in the United States and in April 1971 in the UK. The album was Bowie's first with the nucleus of what would become the \"Spiders from Mars\", the backing band made famous by The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars in 1972. Though author David Buckley has described the singer's previous record David Bowie (Space Oddity) as \"the first Bowie album proper\", NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray have said of The Man Who Sold the World, \"this is where the story really starts\". It has been claimed that this album's release marks the birth of glam rock."}]}
