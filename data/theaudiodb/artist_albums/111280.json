It was the first album released by the band after the departure of guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. He was replaced by Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, both guitar players, singers and songwriters. Fleetwood Mac thus became a six-piece band with four singer/songwriters. The album was not as successful as its predecessor, Tango in the Night, nor did it spawn any big hit singles although \"Save Me\" made the US Top 40, while \"Love Is Dangerous\" and \"Skies the Limit\" enjoyed some airplay. Though it barely reached the US Top 20, the album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and achieved platinum status there.\nThe cover for the album was created by photographer, Dave Gorton.

Released in 1979, it is considered experimental, primarily due to Lindsey Buckingham's sparser songwriting arrangements and the influence of punk rock and New Wave on his production techniques. Bassist John McVie has commented that the album sounds like \"the work of three solo artists\" (Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie), whilst Mick Fleetwood later proclaimed that it is his favourite and the best Fleetwood Mac studio album created by the group. Costing over one million dollars to record (a fact widely noted in the 1979 press), it was the most expensive rock album made up to that point.\nTusk peaked at #4 in the US and was certified double platinum for shipping two million copies. It peaked at #1 in the UK and achieved a Platinum award for shipments in excess of 300,000 copies. The album gave the group two US top-ten hit singles, with the Buckingham-penned title track (US #8/UK #6), and the Stevie Nicks composition \"Sara\" (US #7/UK #37). Further releases from the album, \"Not That Funny\" (UK only single release), \"Think About Me\" and \"Sisters of the Moon\" were less successful; however, the latter two appear in their 'single versions' on the 2002 compilation The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. \"Sara\" was cut to 4\u00c2\u00bd minutes for both the single and the first CD release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the 1988 Greatest Hits compilation and the 2004 reissue of Tusk as well as Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions for Tusk, but his playing on the Christine McVie track \"Brown Eyes\" is not credited on the album.\nThough the album sold four million copies worldwide, in comparison to the huge sales of Rumours and the unprecedented recording expense, the band's record label deemed the project a failure, laying the blame squarely with Buckingham himself. Fleetwood, however, blames the album's relative failure on the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping. In addition, Tusk was a double album, with a high list price of $15.98.\nThe band embarked on a huge 18-month tour to promote Tusk. They travelled extensively across the world, including the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany they shared the bill with reggae superstar Bob Marley. It was on this world tour that the band recorded music for the Fleetwood Mac Live album, which was released at the end of 1980.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"1","strReview":"","strMood":"Relaxed","strTheme":null,"strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"22deeac8-6009-31ad-a069-26e85d246412","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strAllMusicID":"mw0000190000","strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":"tusk","strDiscogsID":"38741","strWikidataID":"Q749617","strWikipediaID":"Tusk_(album)","strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2110248","idArtist":"111280","idLabel":null,"strAlbum":"Mr. Wonderful","strAlbumStripped":"Mr Wonderful","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistStripped":"Fleetwood Mac","intYearReleased":"1968","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Rock","strLabel":null,"strReleaseFormat":"Album","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/xwpqtq1505557295.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":null,"strAlbumCDart":"","strAlbumSpine":null,"strAlbum3DCase":null,"strAlbum3DFlat":null,"strAlbum3DFace":null,"strAlbum3DThumb":null,"strDescriptionEN":"Released in 1968, Mr. Wonderful is the second album by the blues-rock band, Fleetwood Mac.

Largely recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Don't Stop\", \"Dreams\", and \"You Make Loving Fun\" were released as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide.\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":"2","intScore":"9.3","intScoreVotes":"6","strReview":"Rumours by Fleetwood Mac has taken on a life of its own. Selling over 30 million copies world-wide, it has assiduously worked its way into so many households since its release in February 1977, that it's become part of the sonic furniture. It is as much a part of that year's landscape as Never Mind The Bollocks, \"I Feel Love\" or Saturday Night Fever and arguably the one least tainted by the passage of time.\nIt had been a tumultuous 1970s for Fleetwood Mac when they came to record this album on America's West Coast. After being left rudderless in the wake of founder Peter Green's departure, the core of drummer Mick Fleetwood, bassist John McVie and his keyboard-playing wife, Christine had finally found some form of stability and commercial success by adding the young singer-songwriting team of Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. And then, after tasting triumph, it all fell apart, amidst affairs and acrimony. With every member of the band touched by some degree of relationship hell, they made a trouble-filled, cocaine-fuelled album . . . that sounded like a thousand angels kissing you sweetly on the forehead.\nBuckingham emerges as top dog here; his swooping, ramshackle \"Second Hand News\" (with its euphoric chorus finally arriving two minutes into the song), \"Never Going Back Again\" and \"Go Your Own Way\" dominate the album. But it is far from a one-man show \u201d\u201c Nicks' \"Dreams\" is a beautifully insistent, sweetly nagging understated plea to lost love, while Christine McVie's \"Don't Stop\", \"Songbird\" and \"You Make Loving Fun\" typify proper, grown-up music.\nSonically, it's near perfect \u201d\u201c there is little fuss, no mess and hardly any waste. If the age was about redundant excess, you are hard pushed to hear any of it on tunes like \"Don't Stop\" or especially \"Dreams\", which both benefit from incredibly sparing instrumentation \u201d\u201c there is so much left out, it makes the tunes somehow seem busier by memory.\nIt became one of biggest records of all time, providing an antidote to the era while remaining entirely in step with its times. It led the group to make its thoroughly crazy yet quite beautiful follow-up, Tusk in 1979, bereft of the editing and economy that makes Rumours so very special.","strMood":"Relaxed","strTheme":null,"strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"416bb5e5-c7d1-3977-8fd7-7c9daf6c2be6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strAllMusicID":"mw0000193833","strBBCReviewID":"r563","strRateYourMusicID":"rumours","strDiscogsID":"38722","strWikidataID":"Q695405","strWikipediaID":"Rumours_(album)","strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2110250","idArtist":"111280","idLabel":"45403","strAlbum":"Say You Will","strAlbumStripped":"Say You Will","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistStripped":"Fleetwood Mac","intYearReleased":"2003","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Rock","strLabel":"Reprise Records","strReleaseFormat":"Album","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/qyquts1352400265.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumbback/kcunvj1603542208.jpg","strAlbumCDart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/say-you-will-53bdcb85e4cca.png","strAlbumSpine":null,"strAlbum3DCase":null,"strAlbum3DFlat":null,"strAlbum3DFace":null,"strAlbum3DThumb":null,"strDescriptionEN":"Say You Will is the 17th album by British/American band Fleetwood Mac, released in 2003.

It was the band's second eponymous album; the first was their 1968 album. This is the first Fleetwood Mac album to feature Lindsey Buckingham as guitarist and Stevie Nicks as vocalist, after Bob Welch departed the band in late 1974.\nThe album reached number one on the Billboard 200 over a year after entering the chart. It launched three top twenty singles: \"Over My Head\", \"Rhiannon\" and \"Say You Love Me\", the last two falling just short of the top ten, both at No. 11. In 1976, it was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA representing shipments of five million units.\nUntil the release of this album, Fleetwood Mac's albums generally sold around 300,000 - 350,000 copies apiece. This album helped launch them as musical superstars with an almost constant radio presence (which would be continued with their even more popular follow-up, Rumours). In 2003, the album was ranked No. 183 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nIn Britain, the album was initially largely ignored and the first three singles lifted from the album failed to chart, therefore, generating limited interest in the album and the new line-up of the band. Only \"Say You Love Me\" charted on the UK Singles Chart and it reached No. 40. With the massive success of Rumours in 1977 and interest in the band re-ignited, Fleetwood Mac was issued again in 1978, along with the re-release of \"Rhiannon\" which peaked just outside the Top 40 at No. 46. The album eventually peaked at #23 on the UK Album Chart but was a prelude to a run of hugely successful albums for the band in Britain, including four multi-platinum number ones: Rumours, Tusk, Tango in the Night and Behind the Mask.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"3","strReview":"","strMood":"Relaxed","strTheme":null,"strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"6b5d9bf1-f496-34b5-9488-7df2533d6208","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strAllMusicID":"mw0000049075","strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":"fleetwood_mac","strDiscogsID":"38776","strWikidataID":"Q1427756","strWikipediaID":"Fleetwood_Mac_(1975_album)","strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2110254","idArtist":"111280","idLabel":null,"strAlbum":"Penguin","strAlbumStripped":"Penguin","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistStripped":"Fleetwood Mac","intYearReleased":"1973","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Rock","strLabel":null,"strReleaseFormat":"Album","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/vwqpvy1341424048.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":null,"strAlbumCDart":"","strAlbumSpine":null,"strAlbum3DCase":null,"strAlbum3DFlat":null,"strAlbum3DFace":null,"strAlbum3DThumb":null,"strDescriptionEN":"Penguin is the seventh album by British rock band Fleetwood Mac, released in 1973.

The record, appearing after the group's sudden success in the pop charts, offered a broader stylistic range than the classic blues of the group's first two albums. The title is taken from Duke Orsino's opening line, \"If music be the food of love, play on,\" from William Shakespeare's comedy play Twelfth Night.\nThis was the band's first release with Warner/Reprise after being lured away from Blue Horizon and a one-off with Immediate Records. Forty years on, Fleetwood Mac remain with Warner. The album, which at its original UK release had an unusually long running time, has been released with four different song lineups.

The enhanced section contained rare live performances, interviews, music videos and footage of the band making their next album.\nThe UK version of 2002 was not enhanced, and contained a few songs from the Peter Green-led blues era of Fleetwood Mac.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"1","strReview":"","strMood":"Relaxed","strTheme":null,"strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"7a815e9e-7fa4-3d9e-a9ea-3d15a3ff677d","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strAllMusicID":null,"strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":null,"strDiscogsID":null,"strWikidataID":null,"strWikipediaID":null,"strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2125930","idArtist":"111280","idLabel":null,"strAlbum":"Mirage","strAlbumStripped":"Mirage","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistStripped":"Fleetwood Mac","intYearReleased":"1982","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Rock","strLabel":null,"strReleaseFormat":"Album","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/vj6dde1605169221.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumbback/utyqtx1590338418.jpg","strAlbumCDart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/noxvcx1605169201.png","strAlbumSpine":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/spine/xrvpux1590338381.jpg","strAlbum3DCase":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dcase/jnjrfb1605169211.png","strAlbum3DFlat":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dflat/dje5s71605169237.png","strAlbum3DFace":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dface/ruzctf1605169244.png","strAlbum3DThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dthumb/hokmby1605169229.png","strDescriptionEN":"Mirage is the 13th studio album by Fleetwood Mac, released on June 18, 1982.\n\nFollowing a hiatus of over a year after the completion of the worldwide Tusk tour, the band temporarily relocated to Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville in France to record this 12-track collection. By this time Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had each commenced a solo side-career, the former to multi-platinum #1 success with 1981's Bella Donna, the latter faring not as well with his first outing Law and Order (US Billboard #32).\n\nMirage found the band venturing further into radio-friendly soft rock than it had in any of its previous incarnations. It stood in stark contrast to its highly experimental predecessor, 1979's Tusk. Mirage yielded several hit singles: \"Hold Me\" (which peaked at #4 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Chart, remaining there for seven weeks), \"Love in Store\" (#22 US Pop Chart), \"Oh Diane\" (which reached #9 in the UK), and finally, \"Can't Go Back\" (issued on 7\" and 12\" in the UK).\n\nThe Stevie Nicks composition \"Gypsy\" (#12 Pop, #4 Rock, and a #1 hit in Canada) was the second single from the album and was accompanied by a lengthy video, the highest-budget music video ever produced at the time, directed by Russell Mulcahy, and was the very first \"World Premiere Video\" on MTV in 1982. The single and album edit of \"Gypsy\" ran for only 4:24, but a 5\u00bd-minute version had been originally recorded and it was this version used for the video. This full-length version was not made available on CD until 1992's retrospective box set 25 Years \u2013 The Chain.\n\nOf the other two compositions from Nicks on the album, \"That's Alright\" dated back to the Buckingham/Nicks days of 1974, whilst \"Straight Back\" was written in the winter of 1981 and referred to her separation from (then) lover, producer Jimmy Iovine, and the huge wrench she experienced having to leave her newly established and highly successful solo career to re-join Fleetwood Mac for the 1982 project (Nicks refers to this on the DVD commentary to her 2008 retrospective Crystal Visions \u2013 The Very Best of Stevie Nicks). \"Straight Back\" was also a US radio hit in winter 1982.\n\nThe album was certified double platinum for shipping 2,000,000 copies in the US and returned the group to the top of the U.S. charts for the first time since their 1977 hit album Rumours, spending five weeks at the top. It also reached #5 in the UK where it was certified platinum for shipping 300,000 copies, and #2 in Australia. The album entered the 'Billboard top 200 albums chart' at #50, it then climbed to #9 the following week, #3 in its third week and began its five-week run at #1 in its fourth week. After five weeks at the top, in its ninth week it fell to #2 where it stayed for eleven weeks. In its twentieth week, the album fell to #13 and dropped to #14 the next week. In its twenty-second week, 'Mirage' plummeted to #33 and fell further the next week to #53. 'Mirage' spent 35 weeks in the top 100, 22 weeks in the top 40 and 19 weeks in the top 10.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"2","strReview":"","strMood":"Relaxed","strTheme":null,"strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"a0e25b7f-30d4-3e87-b469-df315573bb16","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strAllMusicID":"mw0000189999","strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":"mirage","strDiscogsID":"38703","strWikidataID":"Q594244","strWikipediaID":"Mirage_(Fleetwood_Mac_album)","strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2144827","idArtist":"111280","idLabel":null,"strAlbum":"The Pious Bird of Good Omen","strAlbumStripped":"The Pious Bird of Good Omen","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistStripped":"Fleetwood Mac","intYearReleased":"1969","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Rock","strLabel":null,"strReleaseFormat":"Compilation","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/the-pious-bird-of-good-omen-52afdc799f466.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":null,"strAlbumCDart":"","strAlbumSpine":null,"strAlbum3DCase":null,"strAlbum3DFlat":null,"strAlbum3DFace":null,"strAlbum3DThumb":null,"strDescriptionEN":"The Pious Bird of Good Omen is a compilation album by Fleetwood Mac, released in 1969.

In addition, a number of other compilations featuring material dating from Fleetwood Mac's February 1970 residency at the Boston Tea Party appeared during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, Snapper Music released a three-volume CD set, titled Live in Boston: Remastered (later reissued as Live at the Boston Tea Party), which collected virtually all of the available tracks from the Boston Tea Party concerts. These three volumes have subsequently been available individually or as a box set. All three volumes were reissued as a four LP set in 2003, under the title Live at the Boston Tea Party. In 2013, the set was repackaged as simply Boston, including new album art and photographs of the band members\u2019 faces on each of five beer coasters.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"strReview":"","strMood":"Relaxed","strTheme":null,"strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"a1ad21db-0072-31dd-9f75-7c9ba084a5c6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strAllMusicID":null,"strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":null,"strDiscogsID":null,"strWikidataID":null,"strWikipediaID":null,"strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2180864","idArtist":"111280","idLabel":"45403","strAlbum":"The Dance","strAlbumStripped":"The Dance","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistStripped":"Fleetwood Mac","intYearReleased":"1997","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Rock","strLabel":"Reprise Records","strReleaseFormat":"Live","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/stysxy1521385080.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumbback/lpr6f21603622869.jpg","strAlbumCDart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/g2nmaa1605169273.png","strAlbumSpine":null,"strAlbum3DCase":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dcase/ck66691605169298.png","strAlbum3DFlat":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dflat/x43dos1605169315.png","strAlbum3DFace":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dface/2swgw41605169323.png","strAlbum3DThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dthumb/g35b8l1605169305.png","strDescriptionEN":"Two years after the Lindsey Buckingham/Stevie Nicks/Christine McVie-less incarnation of Fleetwood Mac crashed and burned, their classic '70s lineup reunited for an MTV Unplugged session and an accompanying tour. Although it's likely that the reunion was for monetary purposes, it made creative sense as well -- no members were as compelling solo as they were with the group. Despite this, the Unplugged-styled setting wasn't ideal for a reunion, since the group decided to devote nearly a quarter of The Dance to new material, inevitably resulting in unfair comparisons to their warhorses. Since there's so much new material, The Dance can't be a truly nostalgic experience either, because the new songs interrupt the flow. Not that they're bad -- both Buckingham's gentle \"Bleed to Love Her\" and nervy \"My Little Demon\" are first-rate -- but they aren't given the full-fledged production they deserve. Similarly, the older songs suffer from the slightly hollow unplugged production. All the hits are performed in nearly identical arrangements to the originals, with the exception of Buckingham's solo \"Big Love\" (an improvement on the original) and the addition of Tusk's marching band to \"Don't Stop,\" which makes the differences all too apparent. Much is the same -- McVie and Nicks sound terrific, and the band is tight and professional -- but Buckingham has lost some of his range, which undercuts some of his songs. Still, that isn't enough to prevent The Dance from being an entertaining listen; it just isn't a substantial one.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":"9","intScoreVotes":"1","strReview":"","strMood":"Relaxed","strTheme":"","strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"1fdc9549-d42a-3f46-9b6f-f1bcc2f167fc","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"bd13909f-1c29-4c27-a874-d4aaf27c5b1a","strAllMusicID":null,"strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":null,"strDiscogsID":null,"strWikidataID":null,"strWikipediaID":null,"strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2199502","idArtist":"111280","idLabel":null,"strAlbum":"English Rose","strAlbumStripped":"English Rose","strArtist":"Fleetwood Mac","strArtistStripped":"Fleetwood Mac","intYearReleased":"1969","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Rock","strLabel":null,"strReleaseFormat":"Compilation","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/english-rose-522f157bbb4c7.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumbback/6giqzj1603622457.jpg","strAlbumCDart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/english-rose-522f154cae33b.png","strAlbumSpine":null,"strAlbum3DCase":null,"strAlbum3DFlat":null,"strAlbum3DFace":null,"strAlbum3DThumb":null,"strDescriptionEN":"English Rose is a compilation album by Fleetwood Mac, released in January 1969.
