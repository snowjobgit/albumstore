The release of the single in June 2007 resulted in just under half of the songs from the album becoming singles. It was produced by the band and their longtime producer Ken Nelson. The song features synthesizers played by Brian Eno and engineered by Rich Costey.\n\nIn September 2006, it was announced through a question and answer section at Coldplay.com that \"White Shadows\" would be the fifth single released from X&Y in Australia. This would have made it the sixth song overall to be released from the album, following the limited releases of \"The Hardest Part\" and \"What If\". Weeks later it was reported on the band's official message board that \"White Shadows\" would not be the next single. This came not long after they decided not to release a DVD of a June 2006 performance in Toronto. No reasons were ever given.\n\nAlthough \"White Shadows\" was not released as a worldwide single, the song was released as a radio-only single in Mexico in June 2007 to promote the band's Latin America Tour.\n\nDespite the song's low profile release in mid-2007, critics were positive, even before the track was officially released as a single. In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, music contributor David Browne wrote that the line \"part of a system I am, I am\" from the chorus is a reference to the band's \"celestial\" sound. Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH assumed that the \"system\" referred to in this line was \"Capitalism ... with fair trade fluffiness attached\", noting that Chris Martin does not write songs for a \"specialist audience\". Hubbard also noted that \"White Shadows\" segues into the next song on the X&Y album, \"Fix You\". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters described \"White Shadows\" as \"terrific\". Begrand also wrote that \"'White Shadows' and the aptly titled 'Low' both draw slightly from Berlin-era David Bowie\".","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tvwrwr1340356820.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"7a139373-9d60-48a8-a4a5-8ab5f7ac3689","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c50b180a-12c9-3153-8ba5-eac6a6537d6f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32724218","idAlbum":"2109618","idArtist":"111239","idLyric":"102222","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Fix You","strAlbum":"X&Y","strArtist":"Coldplay","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"294000","strGenre":"Pop-Rock","strMood":"Relaxed","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"Slow Dance","strDescriptionEN":"\"Fix You\" is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was written by all four members of the band for their third album, X&Y. The track is built around an organ, that is accompanied by slow tempo drums, and a vocals. It was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X&Y and has reached number four in the United Kingdom Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US.\nBlythe Danner, the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's mother-in-law, stated in an interview in May 2012 that Chris Martin 'wrote the song Fix You for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep every time I hear it'.\n\"Fix You\" received positive reviews. It has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds. The song, itself, was nominated for multiple awards in the categories of Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Anthem of the Summer. The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nThe guitar solo of \"Fix You\" is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens' home games.\nThe song was played live to a motionless crowd at the Steve Jobs memorial/celebration-of-life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino, CA.\n\"Fix You\" covered by Boyce Avenue was used in the video \"Internet Love Story: CTFxC Wedding (Charles & Alli)\" uploaded by user charlestrippy on 22 November 2011. As of 27 April 2012 it currently has 2,330,161 views.\n\nThe music video for \"Fix You\" was directed by Sophie Muller, who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video \"In My Place\". The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, England, which were the band's first ever stadium performances. The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot, which required two takes on each day to complete. In the first half of the video, Martin, wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge station, while the slogan \"Make Trade Fair\" is projected onto the Royal National Theatre, using the same Baudot code colour scheme on the cover of X&Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around King's Cross and St Pancras railway stations, with the filming for the video taking place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of the latter. Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge, which crosses the River Thames, connecting the South Bank with The Strand. As soon as the electric guitar kicks in, Martin's walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London, until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, where he joins the rest of the band for the song's finale. The audience sings along with the song's final refrain, and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight.\n\nThe video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before they occurred.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xwqrtp1340356523.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4V3Mo61fJM","strMusicVidDirector":"Sophie Muller","strMusicVidCompany":"Angelo Prod","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/twryxu1363710300.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/quswrs1363710650.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vxtwqy1363710824.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"358113485","intMusicVidLikes":"1501260","intMusicVidDislikes":"43019","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"63022","intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.77778","intScoreVotes":"9","intTotalListeners":"1549920","intTotalPlays":"13491338","strMusicBrainzID":"20919a48-4ad5-409c-b639-8db7ca9f9e7a","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c50b180a-12c9-3153-8ba5-eac6a6537d6f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32724219","idAlbum":"2109618","idArtist":"111239","idLyric":"102228","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Talk","strAlbum":"X&Y","strArtist":"Coldplay","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"311000","strGenre":"Pop-Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Talk\" is a song by the British alternative rock band Coldplay.

The song's drumbeat is similar to Bush's 1985 song \"Running Up that Hill\". Upon the song's release, it charted in the UK Singles Chart in the number two position. In the United States, it reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, their first top ten hit in the country, and their most successful song until Viva La Vida reached number one in 2008.\n\n\"Speed of Sound\" was recognised Song of the Year by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and it was nominated twice at the 48th Grammy Awards.
