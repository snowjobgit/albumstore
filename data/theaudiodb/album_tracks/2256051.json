It was released as the lead single from his twenty-fifth and final studio album of the same name on 19 November 2015. \"Blackstar\" peaked at number 61 on the UK Singles Chart, number 70 on the French Singles Chart and number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Blackstar\" received both the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song and the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 59th Grammy Awards. At 9:57, it is the longest song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 charts.\n\nThe music video for \"Blackstar\" is a surreal ten-minute short film directed by Johan Renck (the director of The Last Panthers, the show for which the song was composed). It depicts a woman with a tail, played by Elisa Lasowski, discovering a dead astronaut and taking his jewel-encrusted skull to an ancient, otherworldly town. The astronaut's bones float toward a solar eclipse, while a circle of women perform a ritual with the skull in the town's centre.\n\nThe film was shot in September 2015 in a studio in Brooklyn. The filmmaking process was highly collaborative, with Bowie making many suggestions and sending Renck sketches of ideas he wanted incorporated. While both men agreed to leave the video open to interpretation (Renck initially refused to confirm or deny that the astronaut in the video was Major Tom), Renck has offered several details regarding its meaning. Renck later said on a BBC documentary \"to me, it was 100% Major Tom.\" It was Bowie who requested that the woman have a tail, his only explanation being \"it's kind of sexual\". Renck has speculated that Bowie may have been contemplating his own mortality and relevance to history while developing the video, but said that the crucified scarecrows were not intended as a messianic symbol. Renck has also stated that Bowie portrays three distinct characters in the video: the introverted, tormented, blind \"Button Eyes\"; the \"flamboyant trickster\" in the song's middle section; and the \"priest guy\" holding the book embossed with the \"\u2605\" symbol. Saxophonist Donny McCaslin said that Bowie had told him the song was about ISIL, although an official spokesperson for Bowie denied that the song was inspired in any way by the Middle East situation.\n\nThe choreography, notably that of the three dancers featured in an attic sequence, was drawn from other media, including Max Fleischer's Popeye the Sailor cartoons. \" sent me this old Popeye clip on YouTube and said, 'Look at these guys.' When a character is not active, when they\u2019re inactive in these cartoons, they\u2019re sort of created by these two or three frames that are loops so it looks like they\u2019re just standing there, wobbling. It\u2019s typical in those days of animation and stop-motion, you would do that to create life in something that was inactive. So we wanted to see if we could do something like this in the form of dance, we had to do that.\" The female dancer in the attic sequence also performs a signature movement from the \"Fashion\" music video.\n\nThe official video for Blackstar won the Best Art Direction award at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kszLwBaC4Sw","strMusicVidDirector":"Johan Renck","strMusicVidCompany":"Gisla & Renck","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"40409676","intMusicVidLikes":"280251","intMusicVidDislikes":"18388","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"54128","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"d85c7c30-d49c-4b06-aa47-d255769db322","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"1fd18f5b-9a92-41fd-a590-da6b5cc60d85","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34509434","idAlbum":"2256051","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore","strAlbum":"\u2605","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"285000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"5048b618-20d6-4d62-becf-6a8fd7015640","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"1fd18f5b-9a92-41fd-a590-da6b5cc60d85","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34509435","idAlbum":"2256051","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Lazarus","strAlbum":"\u2605","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"383000","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":"Weird","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Lazarus\" is a song by English rock musician David Bowie. It was released on 17 December 2015 as a digital download, making it the second single from his twenty-fifth studio album, Blackstar (2016). It is Bowie's last single to be released during his lifetime. The single received its world premiere on BBC Radio 6 Music's Steve Lamacq on the day of its release as a single. In addition to its release on \u2605, the track is used in Bowie's off-Broadway musical of the same name. The official music video, directed by Johan Renck, was released on 7 January 2016, three days before Bowie's death.\n\nThe official music video for \"Lazarus\", featuring a shorter edit of the song lasting just over four minutes, was uploaded on 7 January 2016 to Bowie's Vevo channel on YouTube. The video was directed by Johan Renck (who also directed the music video for Bowie's previous single, \"\u2605\") in November 2015; during the week of shooting, doctors reportedly informed Bowie the cancer was terminal and that they were ending treatment. The filming location was a studio in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The video is shown in a 1:1 aspect ratio and prominently features Bowie, appearing with a bandage and buttons sewn over his eyes, lying on a deathbed. A director's cut exists restoring the original widescreen aspect.\n\nThe video finishes with Bowie retreating into a dark wardrobe. In the scenes featuring the wardrobe, Bowie is wearing a diagonally striped suit referencing the back cover of the 1991 CD reissue of the Station to Station album, where he is pictured sitting on the floor drawing the kabbalistic Tree of Life. The Tree of Life is also referenced in the Station to Station lyrics, a \"magical movement from Kether to Malkuth\".\n\nThe video was nominated for three awards: Best Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-JqH1M4Ya8","strMusicVidDirector":"Johan Renck","strMusicVidCompany":"Gisla & Renck","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"50744924","intMusicVidLikes":"428210","intMusicVidDislikes":"19467","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"46102","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"bd0ef97e-edb6-4479-95ad-0c1957edf77b","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"1fd18f5b-9a92-41fd-a590-da6b5cc60d85","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34509436","idAlbum":"2256051","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Sue (or in a Season of Crime)","strAlbum":"\u2605","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"275000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":"7","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"d0b14ae9-3fec-4b42-8462-1461a2061254","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"1fd18f5b-9a92-41fd-a590-da6b5cc60d85","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34509437","idAlbum":"2256051","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Girl Loves Me","strAlbum":"\u2605","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"293000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"5","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"1d894d12-e26c-492b-9086-b80dcb37b79c","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"1fd18f5b-9a92-41fd-a590-da6b5cc60d85","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34509438","idAlbum":"2256051","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Dollar Days","strAlbum":"\u2605","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"276000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"6","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"80e92aee-28c7-4258-9928-b48289539c57","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"1fd18f5b-9a92-41fd-a590-da6b5cc60d85","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34509439","idAlbum":"2256051","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"I Can't Give Everything Away","strAlbum":"\u2605","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"342000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"7","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"a2fd44ce-0e32-4615-8bc3-32f80f58f55d","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"1fd18f5b-9a92-41fd-a590-da6b5cc60d85","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
