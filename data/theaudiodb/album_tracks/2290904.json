It was released digitally on December 7, 2017 from the album's pre-order and was sent to US contemporary hit radio on January 9, 2018, as the album's second single. The song was written by Cabello, Adam Feeney, Leo Rami Dawod, Jacob Ludwig Olofsson, Noonie Bao and Sasha Yatchenko. The song has so far peaked in the top 30 in the UK. Cabello performed the track live for the first time on television on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on January 10, 2018.\n\nComposition\n\"Never Be the Same\" is a mid-tempo ballad that comprises R&B rhythms. Lyrically, the song incorporates themes of pain-is-pleasure type of love. Cabello sings of an addictive love in \"Never Be the Same\", singing in the chorus \"It's you, babe/ And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe/ And I could try to run, but it would be useless/ You're to blame/ Just one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the same.\" Additionally, it features booming drums and echoed effects.\n\nCommercial performance\nThe song impacted radio on January 9, 2018, but due to its success upon release as a promotional single, it had already entered the top 40 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. The song entered at number 61 on the US Billboard Hot 100 as the week's top debut with 30,000 copies sold and 6.1 million streams for its first week of release. \"Never Be the Same\" fell to number 98 in its second week on the Hot 100, due to low radio impact; the song, however, was sent to radio on January 9, 2018. The song fell off the chart the following week, however, it later re-entered at number 71, following the premiere of the unofficial music video posted on Cabello's personal YouTube channel,the official one will be released at a later date.\n\nMusic video\nAn accompanying music video for \"Never Be the Same\" was released on December 29, 2017. The video is a montage of real footage, which includes Cabello's infancy, childhood and adolescence. It mainly includes footage from moments she had in 2017, such as receiving awards at the 2017 MTV EMAs and Billboard Women in Music, performing live and also clips from her previous music videos, \"Crying in the Club\" and \"Havana\".","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tsuttp1516092514.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQhIUzPJi8o","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"3444840","intMusicVidLikes":"229794","intMusicVidDislikes":"3083","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"14500","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"1","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"5","intTotalListeners":"178054","intTotalPlays":"4254713","strMusicBrainzID":"b45d42ba-b9a6-42e7-a6ab-0f24a076814c","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e774d274-e3ee-434a-a5c0-4a113b3b5d8f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"01b8b5bf-06cb-45da-85fb-61ada72fcd69","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34914954","idAlbum":"2290904","idArtist":"147739","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"All These Years","strAlbum":"Camila","strArtist":"Camila Cabello","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"164000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":"81188","intTotalPlays":"949441","strMusicBrainzID":"8fc788e7-26b0-4955-a218-73dd0731bd11","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e774d274-e3ee-434a-a5c0-4a113b3b5d8f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"01b8b5bf-06cb-45da-85fb-61ada72fcd69","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34914955","idAlbum":"2290904","idArtist":"147739","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"She Loves Control","strAlbum":"Camila","strArtist":"Camila Cabello","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"177000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"3","intTotalListeners":"113750","intTotalPlays":"1335477","strMusicBrainzID":"e16332d0-8670-432f-b3ba-e3c7eb69e60f","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e774d274-e3ee-434a-a5c0-4a113b3b5d8f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"01b8b5bf-06cb-45da-85fb-61ada72fcd69","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34914956","idAlbum":"2290904","idArtist":"147739","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Havana","strAlbum":"Camila","strArtist":"Camila Cabello","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"216000","strGenre":"Rap","strMood":"...","strStyle":"...","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Havana\" is a song recorded by Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello featuring guest vocals from American rapper Young Thug. It was released on August 3, 2017 as a promotional single of her debut studio album Camila (2018), along with \"OMG\". On August 30, via social media, Cabello confirmed the song as the album's second single. It was serviced to radio on September 8. On November 12, a remix version of the song with Daddy Yankee was uploaded to Cabello's YouTube page. The first verse of the song is sung in Spanish while Daddy Yankee replaces Young Thug's verse.\n\nDue to the spontaneous success of the song, \"Havana\" became its proper lead single. The song has performed well internationally, reaching number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Scotland and the United Kingdom, as well as the top ten in a number of countries including Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, while peaking at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it became Cabello's highest ranking.\n\nComposition\n\"Havana\" is a mid-tempo track, and lyrically finds the singer embracing her Cuban heritage. Cabello sings the chorus over Latin-influenced piano riffs and rhythm, with the melody's chord progression constantly switching between Gm\u2014E\u266d\u2014D7 and Gm\u2014E\u266dmaj7\u2014D7. Sadie Bell of Billboard interpreted the line \"Half of my heart is in Havana\" as the song chronicling \"a romance that found Cabello's heart left down south,\" while for Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos, in the \"clubby, smooth\" track, Cabello falls in love with \"a mysterious suitor from East Atlanta\", though she has left her heart in her hometown. Young Thug performs a sing-song verse over the \"bouncy\" piano. Some music publications described the song as \"Latin fusion\" and pop. A no-rap version replaces the second verse with Young Thug with Cabello's own lyrics.\n\nMusic video\nCabello shared a 26-second preview of the short film for \"Havana\" on October 22, 2017 through her YouTube channel. The video featured appearances by Lele Pons as Bella, LeJuan James as Grandma Abuelita, Noah Centineo as Cabello's love interest, Marco DelVecchio as the twins Juan and Rodrigo and Mikey Pesante as the dancer. It was directed by Dave Meyers and was released on October 24, 2017.\n\nThe music video starts with Karla, played by Cabello, watching a telenovela, before being interrupted by her grandmother, who turns off the TV and advises her to live her life instead of spending her days indoors. Karla then leaves the house to go see a movie. The film she is watching, called Camila in Havana, takes the form of a music video, starring a version of herself wearing a fringe-covered red dress and performing at a club. Aside from appearing as Karla, Cabello also plays the telenovela actress and the movie protagonist. After the film ends, she leaves the cinema and stumbles across a cyclist, also the male protagonist of the film, and begins dancing with him.\n\nThe video received four nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, for Video of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Video, and Best Choreography, winning Video of the Year. Furthermore it won Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nA vertical video, directed by Sam Lecca, was released on November 10, 2017 on her official Vevo account. The clip shows Cabello and dancers on a New York City subway. The video was previously a Spotify exclusive.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tvpsrt1516092600.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ0mxQXmLsk","strMusicVidDirector":"Dave
