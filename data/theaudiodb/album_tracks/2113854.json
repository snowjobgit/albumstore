It was available for digital download on January 18, 2010. The song received airplay directly after release, officially impacting mainstream and rhythmic radio on January 26, 2010. The song is uptempo R&B, blending together dance-pop and hip-hop elements, while using influences of doo-wop music.\n\nThe song has received positive reviews from critics who complimented the song's effective lyrics and chorus, and commended Ludacris' part and the song's ability to have an urban twist. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number one in France, and charting in the top ten of the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Australia, Norway, Japan, Ireland, Hungary, Belgium (Flanders), Slovakia and New Zealand. The accompanying music video takes place in a mall/bowling-alley setting. The video features several cameos such as Drake and Lil Twist, in which Bieber chases after a girl. In July 12 2010, the video became the most viewed video in YouTube history. It remained that way until 21 December 2012, when it was surpassed by Gangnam Style by PSY. Bieber performed the song several times, including Saturday Night Live, and the ninth season of American Idol. Bieber also performed an acoustic rendition of the remix version with Drake at the 2010 Juno Awards.

The song served as the second single from his album, My World 2.0. It was written by Heather Bright and The Stereotypes, and produced by the latter. The song was originally recorded as a demo by Bieber's mentor, R&B singer, Usher, for his sixth studio album, Raymond v. Raymond (2010). After things went stale with Usher's label, The Stereotypes were encouraged to give the song to Bieber, who recorded it, with Usher performing background vocals. The song is an upbeat dance-pop song, which also derives from R&B genre, while making use of Eurodisco influences. It impacted US mainstream and rhythmic radio on April 20, 2010.\n\nUsher re-recorded featured vocals for the official remix of the song, which was released on June 25, 2010. A variation of the track with slightly different production done by Benny Blanco, features Usher on lead vocals and Bieber as the featured artist. It is included on the follow-up release of Raymond v. Raymond, titled Versus. In Japan, the song was released dually with \"Never Say Never\" as a double A-side single. The song received positive reviews, with critics complimenting the track's dance feel, and the lyrical content. \"Somebody to Love\" became Bieber's third consecutive top ten hit in Canada, and his fourth consecutive top twenty single in the United States. It also reached the top twenty in Germany, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nThe accompanying music video for the official remix, directed by Dave Meyers, was intended to rely solely on choreography, and integrate different styles of dance. It features appearances from several dance crews, such as Beat Freaks and Poreotics. According to critics, the video makes allusions to previous dance-heavy clips by Usher and Chris Brown. Bieber performed the song at a number of venues, including the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and on the seventh series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xuqrwr1359231045.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOI4OF7iIr4","strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"290689762","intMusicVidLikes":"724351","intMusicVidDislikes":"241993","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":"198096","intTotalPlays":"1153073","strMusicBrainzID":"60b13097-f5e5-4ee8-8933-7dc0f3e6bf92","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"eb68ecd6-fb1e-483a-9cda-b595fb4664a7","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"e0140a67-e4d1-4f13-8a01-364355bee46e","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32768616","idAlbum":"2113854","idArtist":"111626","idLyric":"264494","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Stuck
