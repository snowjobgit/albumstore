Written by the band members, the song was produced by Alan Tarney for the group's first studio album Hunting High and Low, released in 1985. The song combines synthpop with a varied instrumentation that includes acoustic guitars, keyboards, and drums.\n\nThe original \"Take on Me\" was recorded in 1984, and took three releases to chart in the United Kingdom, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart in November 1985. In the United States, the song reached the top position of the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1985, due in no small part to the wide exposure of its memorable and cutting-edge music video on MTV, directed by Steve Barron. The video features the band in a pencil-sketch animation method called rotoscoping, combined with live action. The video won six awards, and was nominated for two others at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qqssrp1376605431.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914","strMusicVidDirector":"Steven Barron","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/yqxswq1581511829.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uvuyxu1581511842.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wtwqty1581511851.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"1006343072","intMusicVidLikes":"4442396","intMusicVidDislikes":"159465","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"206664","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"5","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"5","intTotalListeners":"1252494","intTotalPlays":"8138548","strMusicBrainzID":"eb7149bb-bcd9-4ab9-b8c7-6296011c504a","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"af7347df-ef5a-3c41-826d-d884f8916c17","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"7364dea6-ca9a-48e3-be01-b44ad0d19897","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882301","idAlbum":"2122849","idArtist":"113130","idLyric":"534","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Train of Thought","strAlbum":"Hunting High and Low","strArtist":"a-ha","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"254426","strGenre":"Synthpop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vdOgObQvz8","strMusicVidDirector":"Steve Barron","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"624587","intMusicVidLikes":"2263","intMusicVidDislikes":"28","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":"68232","intTotalPlays":"275155","strMusicBrainzID":"b10ea843-9515-47d1-86a7-8486df98049b","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"af7347df-ef5a-3c41-826d-d884f8916c17","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"7364dea6-ca9a-48e3-be01-b44ad0d19897","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882302","idAlbum":"2122849","idArtist":"113130","idLyric":"527","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Hunting High and Low","strAlbum":"Hunting High and Low","strArtist":"a-ha","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"225040","strGenre":"Synthpop","strMood":"Excitable","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Hunting High and Low\" is a song by the Norwegian band A-ha. It was released as the final single from the band's debut album, Hunting High and Low, in 1986.\n\n\"Hunting High and Low\" was released in the summer of 1986 and became the third most successful single from Hunting High and Low on the charts and one of the band's most recognizable and popular songs. The song didn't chart in the U.S., but was a Top 5 hit in Britain and in Ireland.\n\nThe original album version was produced by Tony Mansfield and is played with synthesizers. For release as a single, the track was remixed, containing additional production by Alan Tarney and features an orchestra.\n\nColdplay, who have made their admiration of A-ha known, have been known to perform this song in concert.\n\nThe video was directed by Steve Barron, and once again utilises animation techniques which show singer Morten Harket \"morphing\" into various animals (an eagle, a white shark, and a lion). In 1986, the British TV show Blue Peter featured a special documentary on the making of the \"Hunting High and Low\" video.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vxrqyr1581447965.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VaeFCxta8","strMusicVidDirector":"Steve Barron","strMusicVidCompany":"Limelight Productions","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/urrstq1581511677.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wvsyxv1581511685.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/swxxxw1581511694.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"13532736","intMusicVidLikes":"55975","intMusicVidDislikes":"1395","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"3799","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"2","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"6","intTotalListeners":"180407","intTotalPlays":"905420","strMusicBrainzID":"da291a7e-3d71-4bcf-b5dd-0727d3deb95a","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"af7347df-ef5a-3c41-826d-d884f8916c17","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"7364dea6-ca9a-48e3-be01-b44ad0d19897","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882303","idAlbum":"2122849","idArtist":"113130","idLyric":"532","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"The Blue Sky","strAlbum":"Hunting High and Low","strArtist":"a-ha","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"156733","strGenre":"Synthpop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":"53125","intTotalPlays":"214669","strMusicBrainzID":"f1cda838-c440-45af-a2b7-e004d1a2da78","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"af7347df-ef5a-3c41-826d-d884f8916c17","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"7364dea6-ca9a-48e3-be01-b44ad0d19897","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882304","idAlbum":"2122849","idArtist":"113130","idLyric":"529","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale","strAlbum":"Hunting High and Low","strArtist":"a-ha","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"302866","strGenre":"Synthpop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"5","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"8509c01e-24ed-48a6-add0-90cba426d5ab","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"af7347df-ef5a-3c41-826d-d884f8916c17","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"7364dea6-ca9a-48e3-be01-b44ad0d19897","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882305","idAlbum":"2122849","idArtist":"113130","idLyric":"533","idIMVDB":"2147483647","strTrack":"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.","strAlbum":"Hunting High and Low","strArtist":"a-ha","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"308760","strGenre":"Synthpop","strMood":"Excitable","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" is a song by Norwegian pop rock music band A-ha.
