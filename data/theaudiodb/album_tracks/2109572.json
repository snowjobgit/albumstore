Casale said he was chosen due to Devo's well-known surreal music videos, which would fit Grohl's request for a \"non-video video\", done for just $60,000. The video shows the band performing the song in a room with a paper background while lights strobe and a giant spore floats around them (the spore, described by Casale as \"Foo Ball\", was inspired by the foo fighter phenomenon that named the band, and its original conception was a \"bloated, charred, inflated girl representing Courtney\", but as Grohl's management vetoed the idea, it was replaced by an \"3D HIV virus based on medical models from Scientific America (sic) magazine\"). This is interspersed with footage of Dave Grohl eating chess pieces (an idea by the singer itself, done with \"frame by frame stop-action animation\") and brushing his teeth with what appears to be a butter knife (although there is no blood). During the choruses, Dave Grohl jumps up and down which became famous when fans would jump around like Grohl during live performances. The video was featured in an episode of Beavis and Butt-head.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_rTTsZZ9KE","strMusicVidDirector":"Gerald Casale","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"756894","intMusicVidLikes":"4485","intMusicVidDislikes":"57","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"07dd11b0-8259-466e-b451-463f3b7d7a2c","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"440c9ce8-8ce4-3103-a745-0b385ae70a34","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723628","idAlbum":"2109572","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178359","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Big Me","strAlbum":"Foo Fighters","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"132626","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Big Me\" is the fourth single by the Foo Fighters from their self-titled debut album Foo Fighters. Released in the spring of 1996, the song became a crossover hit for the band on pop radio, when it reached #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay.\nThe song became well known for its music video, which parodies Mentos advertisements, turning them into commercials for \"Footos.\" The concept came from director Jesse Peretz, who had originally pitched the idea to another band, and the Foo Fighters accepted as according to Grohl, \"We had some difficulty finding a treatment that would suit the song, which is this short, tongue-in-cheek, ridiculously candy-coated pop tune. We didn't want to make this big, pretentious portrait video. We wanted to make fun of ourselves and the song.\" The video made its MTV debut on February 14, 1996, and quickly became a Buzz Bin clip.\n\n\"Big Me\" was nominated for 5 MTV Video Music Awards at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, winning only \"Best Group Video\". The video, which parodies the Mentos ad campaign, was filmed on location in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe video's success led to many fans throwing Mentos at the band whenever they played the song live. For an extended period of time, the band did not play the song live due to this, as Grohl cited: \"We did stop playing that song for a while because, honestly, it's like being stoned. Those little \u2026 things are like pebbles \u2013 they hurt.\" The band only started to change its mind after Weezer started performing \"Big Me\" during the Foozer tour both bands did together.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLdJQFTnZfA","strMusicVidDirector":"Jesse Peretz","strMusicVidCompany":"X-Ray
