The British version of the video is in black and white, directed by David Mould. It shows the band performing in a desert setting amidst trucks and filming equipment; the actual filming location is the Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park in northern Los Angeles County, California. By the end of the video, it rains on the band, but they continue playing. This was actually the first version of the video produced, but the band expressed dissatisfaction with it, leading to the other video. Only the US version appears on the band's 1998 video compilation 7 Television Commercials, and both the UK and U.S. versions appear on the Radiohead: The Best Of DVD released in 2008 by EMI.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qFfFVSerQo","strMusicVidDirector":"David Mould","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"30730667","intMusicVidLikes":"140314","intMusicVidDislikes":"4497","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"4026","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"4","intTotalListeners":"1101124","intTotalPlays":"8212783","strMusicBrainzID":"83cf16bc-01db-4766-9e3e-f3c796639cf2","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"b8048f24-c026-3398-b23a-b5e50716cbc7","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"a74b1b7f-71a5-4011-9441-d0b5e4122711","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32749485","idAlbum":"2112024","idArtist":"111418","idLyric":"404180","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Fake Plastic Trees","strAlbum":"The Bends","strArtist":"Radiohead","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"290693","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/ruusqy1487239206.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd06s1LNik","strMusicVidDirector":"Jake Scott","strMusicVidCompany":"Portfolio","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"11873312","intMusicVidLikes":"51230","intMusicVidDislikes":"774","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"3","intScore":"7.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"1092127","intTotalPlays":"8754133","strMusicBrainzID":"1e73e7a6-7378-46e5-97a7-2c299c656a29","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"b8048f24-c026-3398-b23a-b5e50716cbc7","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"a74b1b7f-71a5-4011-9441-d0b5e4122711","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32749486","idAlbum":"2112024","idArtist":"111418","idLyric":"404178","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Bones","strAlbum":"The Bends","strArtist":"Radiohead","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"189000","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"5","intLoved":"0","intScore":"4","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"10b3772d-e300-46a0-b456-415edaf60507","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"b8048f24-c026-3398-b23a-b5e50716cbc7","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"a74b1b7f-71a5-4011-9441-d0b5e4122711","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32749487","idAlbum":"2112024","idArtist":"111418","idLyric":"404176","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"(Nice Dream)","strAlbum":"The Bends","strArtist":"Radiohead","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"233240","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"6","intLoved":"0","intScore":"4","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"b271dd19-ecee-4f87-b98a-a26b724f00e9","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"b8048f24-c026-3398-b23a-b5e50716cbc7","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"a74b1b7f-71a5-4011-9441-d0b5e4122711","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32749488","idAlbum":"2112024","idArtist":"111418","idLyric":"404182","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Just","strAlbum":"The Bends","strArtist":"Radiohead","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"234093","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Just\" is a single by English alternative rock band Radiohead, released in 1995. It is the seventh track on their 1995 album The Bends. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke wrote the song about a narcissistic friend of his, which on closer inspection is showcased by the imagery in the lyrics - a parallel to earlier My Iron Lung EP track \"Lewis \". He also says that it was something of a competition between him and Jonny Greenwood to see who could fit the most chords into a song. \"Just\" is especially notable for Greenwood's guitar solo. In the UK, this single was available as two CDs: the first one featured different tracks, and the colour of the album art on the second single was inverted. In 2007, NME placed \"Just\" at number 34 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_qMagfZtv8","strMusicVidDirector":"Jamie Thraves","strMusicVidCompany":"Oil

band Radiohead, featured as the final track on their second studio album The Bends, which was released in 1995.\n\nNoted by singer-songwriter and guitarist Thom Yorke as \"one of  saddest songs\" and describing it as \"the dark tunnel without the light at the end\", \"Street Spirit\" was released as the band's ninth single and reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, the highest chart position the band achieved until \"Paranoid Android\" from OK Computer, which reached number three in 1997. It remains one of Radiohead's most popular songs and has been covered by many artists. In 2008, the song was featured on Radiohead: The Best Of, a compilation album.\n\nYorke has suggested that the song was inspired by the 1991 novel The Famished Road, written by Ben Okri, and that its music was inspired by R.E.M. The track is built around a soft melody in A minor with an arpeggiated guitar part. It is one of the band's first songs to feature keyboards prominently, a trend which takes over in their music starting in 2000. A previous, working title for the song was \"Three Headed Street Spirit\", as seen in interviews with Thom Yorke preceding the release of The Bends. The single is also acclaimed for the quality of its B-sides; for example, \"Talk Show Host\" rose to prominence after it was remixed by Nellee Hooper for the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet, since becoming a regular at Radiohead concerts.\n\nThe black-and-white music video for \"Street Spirit\" was filmed during two nights in a desert just outside Los Angeles. It premiered in February 1996 and was directed by Jonathan Glazer, who said, \"That was definitely a turning point in my own work. I knew when I finished that, because they found their own voices as an artist, at that point, I felt like I got close to whatever mine was, and I felt confident that I could do things that emoted, that had some kind of poetic as well as prosaic value. That for me was a key moment.\" Glazer would later direct the video for \"Karma Police\".","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/usruxv1487239237.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrZTNhW44-o","strMusicVidDirector":"Jonathan Glazer","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"9378239","intMusicVidLikes":"27629","intMusicVidDislikes":"554","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"3255","intTrackNumber":"12","intLoved":"1","intScore":"7.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"b10175e6-a3d7-4102-b97b-7f1b88c94cd3","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"b8048f24-c026-3398-b23a-b5e50716cbc7","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"a74b1b7f-71a5-4011-9441-d0b5e4122711","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
