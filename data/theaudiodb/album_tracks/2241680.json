The song was written by Perry, Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Bonnie McKee, and Cirkut. \"Roar\" is a midtempo pop song; its lyrics address standing up for oneself.\nSome music critics deemed \"Roar\" a \"determined note\" for Prism, and described it as a \"sure-to-be radio hit\". However other critics thought the lyrics were predictable, \"cheesy\", and contained \"clich\u00e9s\"; describing the song as \"more of a yelp than a roar\".Upon the release, Perry received significant negative press due to accusations of plagiarism stemming from \"uncomfortably close\" similarities between \"Roar\" and Sara Bareilles' \"Brave\".\nThe single became the singer's eighth non-consecutive US Billboard Hot 100 number one, and topped music charts in eight other countries. The music video for \"Roar\" was released on September 5, 2013, which was directed by Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi, and filmed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rywruy1379263556.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8","strMusicVidDirector":"Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/xpqvtq1418387755.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vrsvvs1418387761.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rptqww1418387768.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"3017063688","intMusicVidLikes":"10725247","intMusicVidDislikes":"856574","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"655099","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"2","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":"555536","intTotalPlays":"6245436","strMusicBrainzID":"12f90de0-c330-4664-a43f-05648571f818","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0d8b973c-fcff-4830-b645-a877b8a9a08f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33583878","idAlbum":"2241680","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Legendary Lovers","strAlbum":"Prism","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":"Katy Hudson","intCD":null,"intDuration":"225000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"b53c76d6-e5c0-4e71-be55-0fd3da77b48e","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0d8b973c-fcff-4830-b645-a877b8a9a08f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33583879","idAlbum":"2241680","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"2147483647","strTrack":"Birthday","strAlbum":"Prism","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":"Katy Hudson","intCD":null,"intDuration":"250000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Cheerful","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rxyxyx1398771758.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEUg7OplvIQ","strMusicVidDirector":"Marc Klasfeld","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"72230235","intMusicVidLikes":"553087","intMusicVidDislikes":"60654","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"40866","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"82f75084-9d8a-48cb-b6bc-5530008907c3","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0d8b973c-fcff-4830-b645-a877b8a9a08f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33583880","idAlbum":"2241680","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Walking on Air","strAlbum":"Prism","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":"Katy Hudson","intCD":null,"intDuration":"197000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"3a37377b-68ec-4a85-9801-cd8e8c0f285e","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0d8b973c-fcff-4830-b645-a877b8a9a08f","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33583881","idAlbum":"2241680","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Unconditionally","strAlbum":"Prism","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":"Katy Hudson","intCD":null,"intDuration":"236000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Cheerful","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Unconditionally\" is a song by Katy Perry for her fourth studio album, Prism (2013).

It was released on September 17, 2013 by Capitol Records as the first promotional single from Perry's fourth studio album, Prism (2013), following the lead single \"Roar\". Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17. Both artists co-wrote the song with its producers, Max Martin, Cirkut, and Dr. Luke, alongside Sarah Hudson. The song was originally conceived by Perry and Hudson during a writing session in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California, and Juicy J, another artist on Dr. Luke's label Kemosabe Records, was later commissioned for a verse on the song.\n\"Dark Horse\" combines the genres of pop and trap music, creating what has been described as a \"Southern rap-techno mashup.\" The track features a minimal production, with Perry's vocals being sung in a \"seductive\" and \"mature\" tone, while Juicy J is featured on the song's intro and rapped-bridge. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a \"witchy, spell-y kind of black magic-y idea\", so she wrote it from the perspective of a witch warning a man not to fall in love with her because if he does, she will be his last. The song was part of a competition sponsored by Pepsi in which fans could vote via Twitter on whether they would prefer \"Dark Horse\" or \"Walking on Air\" to be released as the first promotional single from Prism.\nUpon release, \"Dark Horse\" received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, who praised its experimentation with urban music but were divided on Juicy J's contribution to the song. \"Dark Horse\" has been a commercial success, charting at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, Canadian Hot 100, and the Netherlands Dutch Top 40 and Mega Single Top 100 charts. The song has also reached number two on the New Zealand Singles Chart, the Venezuela Pop Rock Chart, and the Swedish Sverigetopplistan Chart. The song is Perry's tenth song to top the Billboard Digital Songs chart. Perry first performed the song live at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 20, 2013. The song's first major television performance was at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards on January 26, 2014. The next day, a remix featuring Pitbull leaked online. \"Dark Horse\" became Perry's ninth Billboard Hot 100 number one single on January 29, 2014. A music video was released on February 20, 2014.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uxqpvs1419977453.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KSOMA3QBU0","strMusicVidDirector":"Mathew
