The band co-produced it with Brian Eno and Markus Dravs for their fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. Several official versions of the song exist, including vocalist Chris Martin's separate recording with a piano accompaniment, and a version that features American rapper Jay-Z.\n\nAlthough it didn't match the commercial success of the album's previous singles, the song was released on 10 November 2008 as the third official single (fourth overall) off the album to generally positive critical reviews. A live version was released via iTunes following a performance of the band and Jay-Z at the 2009 Grammy Awards, spurring high digital sales and giving \"Lost!\" a new peak at number 40 in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number 54 due to no physical release.\n\nThe accompanying music video to the single features a live performance of the band in the United States. Coldplay launched a contest through their website, in which fans submitted self-made music videos. The winning entries were posted on the band's website.\n\nCanadian singer Lights has covered the song.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tswsyp1340357318.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkgeai985rA","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/xsvrtx1372243295.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wsttxw1372243301.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wwtstp1372243307.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"11123625","intMusicVidLikes":"36393","intMusicVidDislikes":"691","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"1316","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"8353cabb-9649-4964-bb36-a3fd2382bae8","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"a1084754-8bb5-3ebc-bbd2-6a27d48e798a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32724208","idAlbum":"2109617","idArtist":"111239","idLyric":"102208","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"42","strAlbum":"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends","strArtist":"Coldplay","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"237400","strGenre":"Pop-Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":"7.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"fc5f3234-18b3-4218-bc73-aad533dfaeb3","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"a1084754-8bb5-3ebc-bbd2-6a27d48e798a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32724209","idAlbum":"2109617","idArtist":"111239","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Lovers in Japan / Reign of Love","strAlbum":"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends","strArtist":"Coldplay","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"411013","strGenre":"Pop-Rock","strMood":"Relaxed","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Lovers in Japan\" is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay.
