It was released as a single on June 1, 2017, and is off their ninth studio album, Concrete and Gold. The song topped the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in July 2017.\n\nThe song had first been played live in February 2017. The studio version of the song was released as a single on June 1, 2017, making it the band's first single since \"Saint Cecilia\" in 2015. Many music journalists noted the song was expected, but not confirmed, to be off of the band's upcoming ninth studio album, Concrete and Gold. The single was a surprise release, without any prior indication being made of its existence, other than the band's vague allusions to working on music over the course of 2017. Seven weeks after its initial release, the song topped the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart, the seventh song from the band to do so.\n\nA music video for the song was released on the same day. The video features the band performing the song in a nursing home (abandoned St Luke's Hospital in Pasadena, CA), in make-up making them appear as elderly versions of themselves, and end up inciting a riot amongst other patients and orderlies. Multiple outlets, including Billboard and People magazines, felt the music video was an homage to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, while Team Rock noted its additional similarity to the film Cocoon. The video ends with a brief choreographed dance routine, noted by Variety and ABC News as being similar to the routine done in Michael Jackson's video for the song \"Thriller\". The video was directed by band frontman Dave Grohl. The old age makeups were designed by Tony Gardner, and created by Alterian, Inc. The video was inspired by drummer Taylor Hawkins lamenting having to do promotional work for the song and album cycle while the band was beginning to look older; when Grohl told him that \"it doesn't really matter\", Hawkins proposed taking it in the opposite direction, and purposefully making themselves look older, inspiring Grohl to write up a treatment for the video.\n\nThe song is approximately five-and-a-half minutes long, and features a 40-second intro with just soft guitar notes and mellow vocals by Grohl. After the intro, the song erupts into a hard rock sound, featuring heavy, distorted guitar riffs, thunderous drums, and alternating melodically sung and screamed vocals by Grohl. The song features breakdowns similar to that found in heavy metal and noise rock music. A number of outlets described the song as one of the heaviest rock songs the band has ever released. Lyrically, the line \"Wake up/run for your life with me\" is urgently repeated through the song by Grohl.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xsrwpu1506288139.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifwc5xgI3QM","strMusicVidDirector":"Dave Grohl","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"17634384","intMusicVidLikes":"251465","intMusicVidDislikes":"7731","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"18082","intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"1","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"fc66e898-e14a-4bf7-b616-b7b786d135dc","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e0335c44-58cd-433c-86d3-e114b14b7111","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34846859","idAlbum":"2284967","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Make It Right","strAlbum":"Concrete and Gold","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"279000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"52eb073e-c189-4ac6-b2e6-528075ab07d9","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e0335c44-58cd-433c-86d3-e114b14b7111","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34846860","idAlbum":"2284967","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"The Sky Is a Neighborhood","strAlbum":"Concrete and Gold","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"244000","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":"Energetic","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"The Sky Is a Neighborhood\" is a song by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was released as the second single from their ninth album Concrete and Gold on August 23, 2017. As of November 2017, the song had peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart and 7 on the Alternative Songs chart.\n\nThe song was one of the last written and recorded for the band's ninth studio album, Concrete and Gold, being written during a two-week break the band went on after feeling they had already completed the album. Frontman Dave Grohl, inspired by the night sky in Hawaii, wrote what would become \"The Sky Is a Neighborhood\", and recorded the track over the course of a single afternoon. The song was first publicly premiered at a live acoustic show by Grohl and drummer Taylor Hawkins in May 2017, at The Fillmore in San Francisco. The full band first performed the song live at a show in Iceland the following month. The final studio version was released as the album's second single on August 23, 2017.\n\nThe name and phrase \"The Sky Is a Neighborhood\" originated from Grohl's lifelong hobby of stargazing and thinking about the planet's Earth's place in the universe, with him explaining \"One night I was lying out looking up at stars. Just imagining all of these stars as places that have life on them as well, and I decided that the sky is a neighborhood, that we need to keep our s\u2014 together in order to survive in this universe full of life.\" The lyrics were also inspired by the video \"The Most Astounding Fact\" by astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRqiFPpw2fY","strMusicVidDirector":"Grohl","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"37732596","intMusicVidLikes":"326523","intMusicVidDislikes":"10960","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"12859","intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"1","intScore":"9","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"eb2a2bde-c63d-4cee-8183-3e510002b461","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e0335c44-58cd-433c-86d3-e114b14b7111","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34846861","idAlbum":"2284967","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"La
