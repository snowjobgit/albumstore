It was the first single from the group's 2007 album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace. It is one of Foo Fighters' most successful songs; only \"Learn to Fly\" and \"Best of You\" beat its position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with XFM, frontman Dave Grohl stopped short of explaining the meaning behind \"The Pretender\", but alluded its roots go to current political unrest. Grohl noted,\n\"That's the thing with lyrics, you never want to give away specifics, because it's nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song. But, you know, everyone's been fucked over before and I think a lot of people feel fucked over right now and they're not getting what they were promised, and so something to do with that.\"\n\nGrohl also told XFM \"The Pretender\" was not initially planned for the album and happened really quickly.\n\"That song didn't happen until later on in the session. We didn't go into making the record with that song and it happened after we recorded a lot of stuff. Up until that point, I didn't know if we had a good opening song or not. So after we recorded it, I thought, 'oh this is perfect, we have the song to open the record,' and it just became everybody's favorite song. ... It's the type of song that I look forward to opening shows with and it came together really easily. We put that song together in, I don't know, a day, whereas a lot of the other songs we worked on for weeks.\"","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yywqts1340623131.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBjQ9tuuTJQ","strMusicVidDirector":"Sam Brown","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"213904038","intMusicVidLikes":"876012","intMusicVidDislikes":"23236","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"57446","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"6","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"10","intTotalListeners":"1239804","intTotalPlays":"10358451","strMusicBrainzID":"ffb3f2b6-460d-4334-8221-c4912df88972","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0ce4a1f2-7908-3865-8f19-08348546424a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723593","idAlbum":"2109569","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178407","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Let It Die","strAlbum":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"245346","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Let It Die\" is the fourth single from the Foo Fighters' sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.

It was mentioned that it was about personal fights between people, and those people breaking apart, and that the fights are meaningless overall. Further speculation leads to Grohl's forbearance between Courtney Love, and Kurt Cobain (Grohl's former bandmate from Nirvana and Love's husband)'s relationship, drug use, and financial arrangements. Grohl indirectly admitted to the song being about Courtney Love in an interview in 2007.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"0","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":"7","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"485460","intTotalPlays":"2914937","strMusicBrainzID":"a2aa0085-5ff2-466d-a056-43cc89363ca4","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0ce4a1f2-7908-3865-8f19-08348546424a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723594","idAlbum":"2109569","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178405","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Erase/Replace","strAlbum":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"253133","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"503d729a-594e-413d-99bf-f24847670dd4","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0ce4a1f2-7908-3865-8f19-08348546424a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723595","idAlbum":"2109569","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178361","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Long Road to Ruin","strAlbum":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"224880","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Long Road to Ruin\" is the second single from the Foo Fighters' sixth studio album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace. The music video was released on November 1, 2007, with the single released on December 3, 2007. The video features an appearance by actress Rashida Jones, and was directed by Jesse Peretz, who had previously collaborated with the band for \"Big Me\", \"Learn to Fly\", \"The One\", and \"Low\".\n\"Long Road to Ruin\" topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven consecutive weeks and reached number two on the Mainstream Rock Tracks in late 2008. It peaked at number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's number-one position on the Modern Rock chart, gave the Foo Fighters a record-setting feat by becoming the first act to reach number one on the chart in each of four consecutive years.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Long Road to Ruin\" peaked in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart and number one on the UK Rock Chart.\nThis video was a major deal for the band as it had been their first comedic video in nearly 10 years, which harkened back to the origins of their early music videos. The music video of the song is a comedic spoof of a stereotypical 1970s-era hospital soap opera (General Hospital in particular), and is essentially a \"show within a show\". As seen in the opening credit sequence, the Foo Fighters portray the actors who in turn portray the show's characters. Grohl plays \"Davy Grolton\", who stars as the main doctor, \"Hansom Davidoff\". Drummer Taylor Hawkins plays \"Ty Hawkstone\" (\"Les Groper\", Davidoff's womanizing colleague). Guitarist Chris Shiflett plays \"Christopher Mishomotohama\" (\"Little Jimmy\", a severely injured child). Bassist Nate Mendel plays \"Ned Bender\" (\"Saul Goode\", the show's shady antagonist). Actress Rashida Jones guest stars as \"Racinda Jules\" (\"Susan Belfontaine\", the doctor's love interest).\n\nIn order to avoid confusion with the soap opera (also entitled \"Long Road to Ruin\") and the \"real world\", the scenes in the soap opera have brown tones to make it more vintage, while the real world retains normal color. There are various accidents and rifts on-stage (a fight between the cast, Grolton inadvertently hitting Jules in the face). Backstage, Grolton's cast mates read a magazine about him becoming a rock star, and later place his debut album on a dartboard and throw darts at it. Upset, Grolton goes outside, only to find screaming teenage girls who want his autograph. After wiping away tears, he accommodates and interacts with them.\n\nThe video then cuts to a concert in a mall where he fronts \"The Davy Grolton Band\" and performs the song. The band is also portrayed by the other Foo Fighter members, in attire appropriate of the era. The scene is inter-cut with flashbacks about Jules. While singing, he sees her amidst the audience filled with the ravenous girls, but she leaves after realizing he has spotted her. He ends the performance to give chase with the fans behind him, but when he finally finds her, she has driven off. Grolton becomes hysterical before continuing his pursuit.\n\nThe video is interspersed throughout with scenes of Grolton driving in a car, wistfully singing the song. The final scene has him intentionally driving off a cliff in a typical 1970s television or movie death scene, with the vehicle bursting into flames during the fall. Grolton is clearly in an open-top Jaguar E-Type, but in what was likely an intentional continuity error (or the fact that the E-Type was too valuable to destroy), the vehicle that's crashed appears to be a 1990s Porsche 911. The stock footage would later be used at the end of the video for \"White Limo,\" a track from the following album.\n\nAn alternative version of the video, consisting of the Davy Grolton Band performance in its entirety, is available on Entertainment Weekly's website, and available to buy on iTunes.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"0","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"619761","intTotalPlays":"3776864","strMusicBrainzID":"49b7fbd1-cfa0-459c-a3ca-1e8c3f7d0a8d","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0ce4a1f2-7908-3865-8f19-08348546424a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723596","idAlbum":"2109569","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178404","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Come Alive","strAlbum":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"310600","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"5","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"342551","intTotalPlays":"1803291","strMusicBrainzID":"fd96ed68-5a47-4f57-ba73-5836f3d46fff","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0ce4a1f2-7908-3865-8f19-08348546424a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723597","idAlbum":"2109569","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178409","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Stranger Things Have Happened","strAlbum":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"321053","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"6","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"349493","intTotalPlays":"2033916","strMusicBrainzID":"0dc4f937-ed9a-453e-bc9b-9cf669090012","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0ce4a1f2-7908-3865-8f19-08348546424a","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723598","idAlbum":"2109569","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178430","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)","strAlbum":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"221173","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)\" is the third single released from the Foo Fighters' 2007 album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.

The b-side is a cover of Paul McCartney & Wings' \"Band on the Run\", which was previously released on Radio 1 Established 1967.\nDave Grohl commented on the song, saying \"For this song, it was a working title that stuck, because that was a song that we had demoed and it sounded like this really bright, poppy, late '80s R.E.M. song that would have been off their 'Green' or something like that.\" Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine says the song has a riff as nimble as those on Foo Fighters' debut
