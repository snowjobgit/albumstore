They met with Max Martin in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California and started writing the track at Playback Recording Studio, which Perry later described as a pure moment for her. After Perry recorded her vocals, McKee presented her idea and the chorus was rewritten. Perry also described the song as reminiscent of her youth while contemplating her future marriage to boyfriend Russell Brand.\n\nMusically, \"Teenage Dream\" is a mid-tempo pop song with a retro sound. It is styled in the genres of power pop and electropop, while taking influence from other genres such as disco, pop rock, and industrial music. Perry starts the song in a high-pitched voice while her vocals grow stronger as the song progresses.

Perry, released as the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, the re-release edition of her second studio album, Teenage Dream. It was written by Perry and Bonnie McKee, with production and additional writing by Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cirkut. The song was not included on the original edition of Teenage Dream because Perry felt that it did not fit the composition of the album. A demo of the song leaked online in late 2010, amid speculation that the lyrics were directed to the singer's ex-boyfriend Travis McCoy. \"Part of Me\" was re-worked and officially released on February 13, 2012, through Capitol Records with artwork by photographer Mary Ellen Matthews.\n\nThe production draws inspiration from several genres, including house music, dance-pop, pop rock and power pop; reviewers compared it to Jessie J's 2011 single \"Domino\", and Perry's 2010 singles \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\". Its lyrics describe a female protagonist who declares herself as un-breakable and strong following a dramatic break-up. Contemporary music critics praised the song's production and gave it mixed-to-positive reviews, although some criticized Perry's vocals. Critics and media alike theorized that the lyrics addressed Perry's divorce from Russell Brand, although Perry denied this and stated that it was written in early 2010.\n\n\"Part of Me\" was a commercial success. It was the twentieth song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Perry's seventh number-one single on the chart, and her ninth consecutive number-one single on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The single debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and Canada, and has been certified Platinum in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Marketing campaigns for Adidas and The Sims 3: Showtime have featured it, and Lindsey Pavao performed the song on Season 2 of The Voice.\n\nAn accompanying music video was filmed at the United States Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, California. The video depicts Perry enlisting in the marines following a heartbreak. It garnered generally positive reviews for Perry's \"Girl Power\" message, but drew criticism from feminist author Naomi Wolf, who denounced it as military propaganda. Perry debuted the first televised performance of song on at the 54th Grammy Awards. Perry has performed the song on several television programs, including the ECHO Awards, the 2012 Kids' Choice Awards, and American Idol.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/urqutu1359422333.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuwfgXD8qV8","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"799470134","intMusicVidLikes":"3337116","intMusicVidDislikes":"167529","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"217527","intTrackNumber":"14","intLoved":"1","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":"358496","intTotalPlays":"3414846","strMusicBrainzID":"eca3290c-253d-458a-a5f2-f11dd1221648","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e6f683c9-fc85-412c-a352-d6e411fc2603","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32849948","idAlbum":"2120401","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Wide Awake","strAlbum":"Teenage Dream","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":"Katy Hudson","intCD":null,"intDuration":"220000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Cheerful","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Wide Awake\" is a song by American recording artist Katy Perry, from the album Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection (2012). The song was written by Perry, Bonnie McKee, Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cirkut, and was produced by Dr. Luke and Cirkut. The song was specifically written for Perry's film Katy Perry: Part of Me, and plays during the end credits. \"Wide Awake\" was released on May 22, 2012 by Capitol Records as the second single from the re-release and overall as the eighth and final single from the album.\n\nA power ballad, \"Wide Awake\" utilizes electronic and dance-pop within its composition, and is lyrically reminiscent of the reality of a break up and moving past it. \"Wide Awake\" was written as part of promotion for her 2012 3D documentary-concert film, Katy Perry: Part of Me. The song was well received by critics, many noting its production and Perry's maturity. \"Wide Awake\" reached number one in multiple countries, including Canada, New Zealand, and Poland, while peaking in the top ten position in Australia, Ireland, Lebanon, Mexico, Scotland, United Kingdom, and Venezuela.\n\n\"Wide Awake\" became her tenth consecutive number-one single on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and her ninth number-one single on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) chart, tying her with Rihanna as the artists with the most number one singles on the chart. The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Perry's eleventh top-ten hit single in the United States, following all seven of the previous singles from Teenage Dream and three out of four singles from her debut album One of the Boys.\n\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Tony T. Datis, was premiered on June 18, 2012. A trailer, directed by Lance Drake, was released on June 12, 2012. It features a fairy tale-plot, where a young girl looks through a story book that features the previous Teenage Dream era singles, each one as a chapter in the book, along with teasers about the fairy tale elements of the official video, which serves as the eighth and final chapter of the book. Perry performed \"Wide Awake\" at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, where it featured Perry floating over the stage with a white ribbon.\n\nIt has been nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held on 10th February 2013. It is also on the shortlist of 75 songs eligible for nomination in the Best Original Song category at the 85th Academy Awards.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rvyyux1359093423.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BWlvnBmIE","strMusicVidDirector":"Tony
