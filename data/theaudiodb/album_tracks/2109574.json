After the tour ended in 2008, the song had its first version recorded during sessions at Grand Master Studios in Hollywood. It would later be brought into the Wasting Light songs which were recorded at Grohl's garage.\nThe song's unusual rhythms and angular chords have a distinct influence from Rush as well as Led Zeppelin's album Presence, which Grohl declared \"may be my favorite album of theirs\". The main progression of chords is a flat seventh, a fourth and a minor third, warrant guitarist Chris Shiflett to comment that \"What my guitar is doing over the bass makes no sense in a way. It does, but you don't know how.\" The intro is a sequence of minor sevenths with a sus four, going from B minor to D, which Shiflett stated was \"kind of illogical, in a way, to your ear\", and Grohl himself compared to Television and Mission of Burma.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/wtwpyt1366228500.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbpqZT_56Ns","strMusicVidDirector":"Dave Grohl","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"12097769","intMusicVidLikes":"58011","intMusicVidDislikes":"925","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"3","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":"419365","intTotalPlays":"2940996","strMusicBrainzID":"bb846d3f-4803-4374-b214-cedd453218f2","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"91825bcf-e51d-4357-986c-ac2a49b4d205","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723653","idAlbum":"2109574","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178423","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Dear Rosemary","strAlbum":"Wasting Light","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"268000","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rPVszLc7n0","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"479302","intMusicVidLikes":"2838","intMusicVidDislikes":"118","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"519fe3bc-9c6e-4e31-8e64-40d7bcb089b1","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"91825bcf-e51d-4357-986c-ac2a49b4d205","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32723654","idAlbum":"2109574","idArtist":"111233","idLyric":"178429","idIMVDB":"2147483647","strTrack":"White Limo","strAlbum":"Wasting Light","strArtist":"Foo Fighters","strArtistAlternate":"The Foo Fighters","intCD":null,"intDuration":"204000","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":"Energetic","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"White Limo\" is a song by the American rock band Foo Fighters.

Light. It was written by Dave Grohl and co-produced by Butch Vig.\nThe song was released on June 6, 2011 to rock radio. No physical CD single was released; it is only a digital downloadable single. The song reached number one on the Billboard Rock Songs chart on July 20, 2011, dethroning the album's previous single \"Rope\", giving the band their third number one single on the chart - the most on the chart so far. On February 12, 2012, the song won two awards at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song. They also performed the song live at the Grammys.\nAccording to Dave Grohl, he came up with the verse about \"having a trial\" after the time he was helping his first daughter Violet Maye on \"learning to walk\", and eventually she was able to walk on her own. The song was supposed to be on the previous studio album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, but Dave decided to put the final version as the last track of Wasting Light because it \"sort of makes sense to the album's theme of time and second chances\" and to \"end the record on a positive note\".\nThe music video premiered online on June 2, 2011. It was directed by Sam Jones and is heavily influenced by the 1993 film Falling Down.\n\nIn 2011, the video won Best Rock Video at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PkcfQtibmU","strMusicVidDirector":"Sam Jones","strMusicVidCompany":"Black Dog Films","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"36449212","intMusicVidLikes":"250686","intMusicVidDislikes":"3159","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"11","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":"468094","intTotalPlays":"3583646","strMusicBrainzID":"25e4dddd-e5b1-412c-8b27-41a1b0b4aebf","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"91825bcf-e51d-4357-986c-ac2a49b4d205","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"67f66c07-6e61-4026-ade5-7e782fad3a5d","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
