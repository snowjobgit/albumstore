It features production from frequent collaborator Jake Gosling. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 72 and rose to number 49 due to strong download sales, despite lacking an independent release.\n\nFollowing the release of his debut studio album, +, in 2011, Sheeran started writing material for his next release. Instead of rush-run and launch an album the next year, the singer decided to take time and focus on writing material that would help expand his career in the United States, like fellow British musician Adele and band Coldplay. \"I'm a Mess\" premiered on 22 June 2014 via MTV, a day before the release of \u00d7, his second album in the United Kingdom and the United States. The track together with \"Thinking Out Loud\" were the last songs he wrote for \u00d7 and were inspired by his then-girlfriend, Athina Andrelos. On 16 July 2014, during the album unveiling in a room in RAK Studios, he noted that he wrote \"I'm a Mess\" while he was in the shower.\n\nIn an interview with New Zealand Herald, he described \"I'm a Mess\" as him being in a bad situation after he hurt a person, \"I think it's important to stay double-sided. I'm very aware I have a lot of flaws too and I think I wear them on my sleeve with this album.\" Talking to News.com.au, he identified the song as \"fairly self-explanatory\" and recalled, \"'I\u2019m a Mess' was definitely written at my lowest point. It actually turned out a lot nicer than what was going on at the time, the lyrics aren\u2019t too mental. That came at the end of a lot of things meeting. After that I was fine. Writing that song sorted everything out.\" Sheeran said that \"I'm a Mess\" is his favourite track from \u00d7.\n\nThe production of \"I'm a Mess\" was done by Sheeran's regular collaborator, Jake Gosling and was recorded at his Sticky Studios in Windlesham, Surrey. Gosling together with Geoff Swan served as the song's engineers while William Hicks did the vocal editing and provided additional vocals. Mark \"Spike\" Stent mixed the track at Mixsuite UK whilst Stuark Hawkos mastered it at Metropolis Mastering in London. All the programming and instrumentation was provided by Sheeran, Gosling and Chris Leonard. A live version of \"I'm a Mess\" was released as a B-side on the 7\" release of \"Thinking Out Loud\".\n\n\"I'm a Mess\" is a pop song with folk music influences and a length of four minutes and five seconds. Its instrumentation included electric guitar notes, backing vocals and a beating drum. According to Sony/ATV Music Publishing's digital sheet music for the song, \"I'm a Mess\" is composed in the key of C minor and set in common time signature, and has a groove of 140 beats per minute. Sheeran's vocals span from the low note of Bb3 to the high note of Bb5. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph described \"I'm a Mess\" as a \"edgy, rocky drama\", whilst according to Jason Lipshutz of Billboard Sheeran uses his \"classic folk voice and sensibility\" to deliver the song's lyrics. MTV News' Emily Blake noted that the stripped down production of the song helps the focus to be on Sheeran's voice. She further elaborated, \"like most of his folk-leaning pop numbers, it\u2019s a track that makes you feel like Sheeran\u2019s singing just to you\" and \" when his voice comes down to a near whisper \u2014 making the whole thing that much more intimate.\"\n\nAccording to Caitlin White of the same publication, \"I'm a Mess\" is a \"lovelorn song\" which shows a different side of Sheeran; instead of being brokenhearted, \"he\u2019s the one that messed up\". He is \"self-reflective\" and \"self-critical\" with one of the verses contain lyrics as, \"And oh, I\u2019ve only caused you pain\" and the chorus features the line, \"Easy baby, maybe I\u2019m a liar\". Billboard's Colin Stutz concluded, \"Sheeran's intimate voice carries over simple guitar strokes as he describes a night of loneliness and longing that erupts with fiery passion.\"","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"0","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"0","intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":"213179","intTotalPlays":"1378647","strMusicBrainzID":"468bb085-0c20-44b3-8ca6-66c65cd688f0","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c24e5416-cd2e-4cff-851b-5faa78db98a2","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33973977","idAlbum":"2212099","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Sing","strAlbum":"x","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"235382","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Philosophical","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"Guys Night Out","strDescriptionEN":"\"Sing\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.

Having played the song for Swift he said, \"She was just like, 'Whatever happens, ever, between us as friends, I never want to piss you off that much,'\". The song started off \"as a riff on his phone\", and was recorded first with Benny Blanco, then again with Rick Rubin with the two producers coming together to produce the final cut. The song almost didn't make it onto the album, as Sheeran felt it was \"a bit personal\", but was urged by those who had heard the demo to release it, as it was \"an alright song... so it ended up on the record\".\n\nAn accompanying music video was released on YouTube on 4 August 2014. The video was directed by Emil Nava and follows a dancer (Philiph Chbeeb from I.aM.mE) going from poverty to wealth.

Sheeran wrote the song with Snow Patrol member, Johnny McDaid, who had a piano loop from which the composition developed. After recording several versions with other producers, Sheeran eventually solicited help from Jeff Bhasker; the collaboration generated a version that Bhasker further enhanced for months. The ballad derives its music primarily from an acoustic guitar, piano and programmed drums. With visually descriptive lyrics, it discusses a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's own experience of being away from his then-girlfriend while he was on tour.\n\nThe song received generally positive commentary from critics, who noted the lyrics and Sheeran's use of imagery. \"Photograph\" served as the fifth and final single from the album. It reached the top five on the main singles charts in more than five countries. In the US, where it peaked at No. 10, \"Photograph\" became the third single from the album to have reached within the top ten. In the UK, it reached No. 15 and has since been certified platinum for sales of 600,000 units. The single has also been certified double platinum in Australia and Canada, and platinum in New Zealand and Italy.\n\nThe single's release on 11 May 2015 followed the premiere of the music video on 9 May 2015. The video is a montage of real home footage of Sheeran's infancy, childhood and adolescence, providing insight on his private early life such as his inclination to playing music instruments and fondness of Lego. The video was nominated for Best Video at the 2016 Brit Awards. Sheeran performed the song on television shows and on his x Tour, which ran from 2014 to 2015.\n\nOn 9 June 2016, it was revealed that Sheeran was being sued by songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, writers of Matt Cardle's 2011 single \"Amazing\", for $20 million for copyright infringement.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSDgHBxUbVQ","strMusicVidDirector":"Emil Nava","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"908400240","intMusicVidLikes":"4659622","intMusicVidDislikes":"132220","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"142986","intTrackNumber":"6","intLoved":"1","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"5","intTotalListeners":"461727","intTotalPlays":"4029876","strMusicBrainzID":"7dcbc1be-4257-4d64-b915-045dfb23ae88","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c24e5416-cd2e-4cff-851b-5faa78db98a2","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33973981","idAlbum":"2212099","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Bloodstream","strAlbum":"x","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"299021","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Philosophical","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Bloodstream\" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter, Ed Sheeran for his second studio album, \u00d7 (2014).

The song is about Sheeran's late grandfather who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The record, which was produced by Snow Patrol member Johnny McDaid, samples elements of \"Remembering Jenny\" composed by Christophe Beck for the soundtrack to the American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\nThe song was released as an \"instant grat\" digital download to the iTunes Store on 16 June 2014, serving as the third of seven promotional singles from \u00d7. Due to high streaming rates, all of the album's 12 tracks including \"Afire Love\" charted in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe song is about Sheeran's late grandfather who suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 20 years. He died of the disease in December 2013, two weeks after Sheeran began writing about it. Sheeran finished writing the song at his grandfather's funeral. Prior to the release of the album, Sheeran had also paid tribute at the 2014 Grammy Awards, in which he wore a necktie belonging to his grandfather.\n\nThe lyrics discusses Sheeran's reaction to the disease as a child all the way up until his grandfather's funeral. In the verses prior to the first chorus, Sheeran recounts the circumstances present upon his grandfather's disease. For instance, he sings the moment when his grandfather lost his capability of recognizing the face of his grandson: \"My father told me, son/ It's not his fault he doesn't know your face/ And you're not the only one.\" The chorus tells the \"powerful love between his grandparents\", in which his grandfather said to his grandmother: \"Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut/ For they're designed to be together/ With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one/ And we're set alight, we're afire in love.\" The song concludes with Sheeran and his family seemingly singing \"hallelujah\" at the funeral.\n\nSheeran recorded \"Afire Love\" in Cocoloco studio in Los Angeles, and Sphere and Metropolis studios in London. It was produced by Snow Patrol member Johnny McDaid, and engineered by Mcdaid and Geoff Swan. The track samples elements of \"Remembering Jenny\", which was composed by Christophe Beck for the soundtrack to the American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The ballad is piano-driven and has a \"grooving\" beat.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"0","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"0","intTrackNumber":"12","intLoved":"0","intScore":"7","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"2c805ab0-6796-4269-b96f-8265f4a2fb8f","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c24e5416-cd2e-4cff-851b-5faa78db98a2","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33973987","idAlbum":"2212099","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Take It Back","strAlbum":"x","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"208000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Philosophical","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Take It Back\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.
