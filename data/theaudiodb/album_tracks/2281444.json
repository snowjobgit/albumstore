It was released on May 19, 2017, and serves as the third single for Perry's fifth studio album, Witness (2017). It is a house-inspired EDM song and samples \"Star 69\" by Fatboy Slim which in turn samples \"I Get Deep\" by Roland Clark and \"What They Say\" by Maya Jane Coles. Brazilian singer Gretchen stars in the \"Swish Swish\" lyric video. The official music video premiered August 24. \"Swish Swish\" is set to be featured in the upcoming dance video game Just Dance 2018, the dance choreography of which also appeared in the official music video.\n\n\"Swish Swish\" was written by Perry, Minaj, Duke Dumont, Sarah Hudson and Starrah, and was produced by Dumont, Noah Passovoy and PJ Sledge. It is a house-inspired EDM song that samples \"Star 69\" by Fatboy Slim which in turn samples \"I Get Deep\" by Roland Clark. Raisa Bruner of Time called \"Swish Swish\" a hip hop song. The track runs for 4 minutes and 2 seconds. Perry said \"Swish Swish\" is a \"great anthem for people to use when someone's trying to hold you down or bully you\". The song is performed in the key of E\u266d major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute in common time. The song follows a chord progression of Cm7\u2013A\u266dmaj7\u2013Gm7\u2013Cm7\u2013A\u266dmaj7\u2013Fm7, and Perry's vocals span from E\u266d3 to A\u266d4.\n\nA lyric video for the song was released on YouTube on July 3, and features Brazilian singer and reality television personality Gretchen. Two days later, Perry announced a contest titled the \"#SwishSwishChallenge\" for dancers to appear in the song's official music video where candidates submit videos of themselves dancing, and she would select her favorite dancer. After applicants posted their entries by the end of July 12, the video was filmed later in the month. A teaser for the official video was posted on August 21 on Perry's personal YouTube account.\n\nThe official music video for the single was directed by Dave Meyers and released on August 24, 2017. It includes appearances from Russell Horning, Gaten Matarazzo, Jenna Ushkowitz, Doug the Pug, Christine Sydelko, Rob Gronkowski, Molly Shannon, Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Rich Eisen, Bill Walton, and Terry Crews. Kia Stevens, Britney Young, Sydelle Noel, Ellen Wong, and Jackie Tohn make appearances as their characters from GLOW. In the video, Perry plays \"Kobe Perry\" the captain of the basketball team \"The Tigers\" whose opponents are known as \"The Sheep\", and Minaj performs during the game's halftime show. The video also features the brief reappearance of Kathy Beth Terry, Perry's character from \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", as well as a brief segment featuring the Bag Raiders song, \"Shooting Stars\". The National Stadium in Warsaw, Poland, was used for exterior views of the venue in the video.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xptwtu1504794106.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGk5fR-t5AU","strMusicVidDirector":"Dave

American singer Katy Perry featuring American hip hop group Migos from Perry's fifth studio album Witness (2017). It was released as the album's second single on April 28, 2017 by Capitol Records. It is a dance-pop and trap-pop song with lyrics that feature oral sex double entendres involving food. Commercially, the song charted at number five and Israel as well as the top twenty in Belgium (Wallonia) and Canada.\n\nDent De Cuir directed the song's music video, which was released on May 12, 2017 and features chef Roy Choi. It first shows Perry wrapped in plastic before chefs cut the wrapping open and \"start kneading her like dough\" before she is boiled in a pot with carrots while singing her lyrics and Choi serves her as a meal to various cannibalizing patrons. Migos watch and rap their verses as Perry rings the bell, signaling them to turn a switch allowing her to turn the tables on the patrons. The patrons are then bound, gagged and then dismembered by the chefs as Perry then dances on a pole. Perry then is served a pie containing dismembered body parts of the patrons.\n\n\"Dent de Cuir's clip for Katy Perry somehow manages the delicate balance of being equally sexy and horrifying. With a title like Bon App\u00e9tit and a neon NSFW sign flickering on at the beginning, there are plenty of places your mind could go with this one. Although if you imagined 'Katy Perry's almost-naked body being stretched and contorted like dough by a room full of chefs before being cooked in a large broth and eventually doing a pole dance for Migos' then your name is probably Dent de Cuir. The rest of us don't need to imagine it - here it is. Perry goes through a full transformation in this video, which expertly pushes the boundaries for what's deemed as acceptably weird in a glossy, shiny pop video.\" (Luke Bather, Promonews)\n\nAt the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, it was nominated for \"Best Art Direction\".","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPI-mRFEIH0","strMusicVidDirector":"Dent de Cuir","strMusicVidCompany":"Caviar","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"685984449","intMusicVidLikes":"4158186","intMusicVidDislikes":"781041","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"301656","intTrackNumber":"11","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"3abf69c6-b16d-4368-991e-bc2a605b7d01","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"bded1701-baf2-4066-b76a-49384de006b6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34806482","idAlbum":"2281444","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Track 12","strAlbum":"Witness","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"240000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"12","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"dc9ebefa-ecbc-4950-a69f-8596d310a3b8","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"bded1701-baf2-4066-b76a-49384de006b6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34806483","idAlbum":"2281444","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Save as Draft","strAlbum":"Witness","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"228000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"13","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"34ce6dd1-c88b-4fe2-868c-ce2ab4b1ae30","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"bded1701-baf2-4066-b76a-49384de006b6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34806484","idAlbum":"2281444","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Track 14","strAlbum":"Witness","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"240000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"14","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"d1964049-1916-4c63-a24e-a8a793cef1a6","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"bded1701-baf2-4066-b76a-49384de006b6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34806485","idAlbum":"2281444","idArtist":"111827","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Into Me You See","strAlbum":"Witness","strArtist":"Katy Perry","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"264000","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"15","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"8165ba17-beb6-4b59-9e9f-9088b76c5210","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"bded1701-baf2-4066-b76a-49384de006b6","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
