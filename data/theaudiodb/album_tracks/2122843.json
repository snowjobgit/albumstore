The song was written by Jepsen, Matthew Koma, Kelly Covell and RedFoo of electropop duo LMFAO through e-mails, text messaging and telephone calls, and was released as the third single from the album on September 10, 2012. The mid-tempo pop track lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved.\n\n\"This Kiss\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who perceived the song's potential. However, it failed to achieve impact similar to \"Call Me Maybe\" and \"Good Time\", reaching the top thirty in Canada and reaching a peak of number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. An accompanying music video was first released on October 26, 2012 at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Jepsen performed \"This Kiss\" on several occasions, such as at The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Late Show with David Letterman, and the halftime show of the 100th Grey Cup at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, between the host Toronto Argonauts and Calgary Stampeders.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/trvsrq1359183768.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf78alvpxRM","strMusicVidDirector":"Justin Francis","strMusicVidCompany":"Hello!","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"28252495","intMusicVidLikes":"167742","intMusicVidDislikes":"10869","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"1","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"5","intTotalListeners":"108592","intTotalPlays":"802741","strMusicBrainzID":"324ad5be-50e4-41e1-8e4e-1c73c6de766e","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e7ce6cac-d26e-470c-b8a1-97ecc07354df","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"09887aa7-226e-4ecc-9a0c-02d2ae5777e1","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882209","idAlbum":"2122843","idArtist":"112627","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Call Me Maybe","strAlbum":"Kiss","strArtist":"Carly Rae Jepsen","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"193000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Excitable","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Call Me Maybe\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012) and appearing on her international debut album, Kiss. The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on 20 September 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, \"Call Me Maybe\" is an upbeat teen pop track that draws influences from dance-pop and disco. Lyrically, the track alludes to the inconvenience that a love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a crush.\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised its composition and clever lyrical content. \"Call Me Maybe\" has attained commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while peaking inside the top three in Austria, Belgium (Flanders & Wallonia), Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. After reaching the top position in Canada, Jepsen became only the fifth Canadian artist to do so in her home country since 2007. In the United States, the track reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Pop Songs chart. The song is the first number one by a Canadian female artist on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2007's \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne. With worldwide sales of over 10 million copies, \"Call Me Maybe\" is one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Ben Knechtel. In it, Jepsen seeks the attention of an attractive boy next door who is revealed at the close of the story to be attracted to a male band member. As part of promotion for the song, the singer has performed the track on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she made her US television debut, and at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. \"Call Me Maybe\" has been covered by several artists, including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Dan Deacon, Fun, Big Time Rush, The Chipettes, R5, Lil' Wayne, Enter Shikari, Ben Howard, Nickelback, Cody Simpson, The Saturdays, Glee and parodied by Cookie Monster and some of the news staff of National Public Radio. It was also covered on the season premiere episode, \"The New Rachel\", of the fourth season of Glee. The song used in in other television shows, Castle, Jane by Design, Degrassi: The Next Generation, and 90210.\n\n\"Call Me Maybe\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual ceremony, which will be held on 10 February 2013. On 11 December 2012, \"Call Me Maybe\" was named Song of the Year of 2012 by MTV. In its 2012 Year-End issue, Billboard Magazine ranked this song #2 in the Hot 100 Songs, Digital Songs, and Canadian Hot 100 Songs charts, in each case behind \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", by Gotye featuring Kimbra. The song was also ranked number one by the Village Voice's annual Pazz and Jop poll, which compiles the votes of music critics from all over the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2012, selling 10 million copies in that year alone, and best-selling single in iTunes Store in 2012.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vsspry1359183885.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic","strMusicVidDirector":"Ben Knechtel","strMusicVidCompany":"Twin Engine Films","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/sxsytq1418393847.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/xpsxqq1418393854.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/srppxs1418393860.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"1251502481","intMusicVidLikes":"5748992","intMusicVidDislikes":"322472","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"591660","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.625","intScoreVotes":"8","intTotalListeners":"793480","intTotalPlays":"7573959","strMusicBrainzID":"00a6443c-6a0e-4618-9509-4476256ee313","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e7ce6cac-d26e-470c-b8a1-97ecc07354df","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"09887aa7-226e-4ecc-9a0c-02d2ae5777e1","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882210","idAlbum":"2122843","idArtist":"112627","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Curiosity","strAlbum":"Kiss","strArtist":"Carly Rae Jepsen","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"213000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Excitable","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Curiosity\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen for her EP Curiosity (2012). It was released as the second single from the EP on May 1, 2012, through 604 Records. Produced and co-written by Ryan Stewart, \"Curiosity\" is an upbeat pop track that is influenced by dance and synthpop. Lyrically, the track alludes to a girl who is poorly treated by a bad boy, and begs for more of his love. It received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who deemed it as similar to Jepsen's previous single, \"Call Me Maybe\". Following its release, the track reached number 18 on the Canadian Hot 100. A new version of the track was included on her international debut album Kiss.\n\nJepsen's first single, \"Call Me Maybe\", was released only in Canada on September 20, 2011. In January 2012, pop singers Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were in the country and heard the track on the mainstream radio. After they tweeted about it on their personal profiles, Jepsen instantly gained international attention, and got signed by Scooter Braun to his Schoolboy Records. Braun revealed that Bieber has \"never jumped out and promoted an artist like this before. He sends me different YouTube videos of unsigned artists that he'd like to work with, but never someone who already had a song out and is on the radio.\" Worldwide distribution of the single was done through Interscope Records. \"Call Me Maybe\" attained worldwide success, reaching number one in Australia, Canada, United States, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, while peaking inside the top ten in Belgium, Netherlands and Norway. Following the surprising performance of the single, Jepsen's second studio effort, Curiosity, was released on February 14, 2012 in Canada only, where it debuted and peaked at number six. The title track was written by Jepsen, while song production and additional writing was done by Ryan Stewart. It was released as the second single from the EP on May 1, 2012.\n\nJepsen shot a video for the song on June 5, 2012 with director Colin Minihan. The music video was not released, and leaked on November 25, 2012. According to the description of the leak, \"this video was shelved because it was \"too sexy\" for her new tween demographic.\" The video starts with Jepsen on a taxi cab with rainy weather. She writes a text message that reads, \"Where are you? I'm outside\". She then leaves the cab, and runs into an unknown house. She knocks at the door, but with no answer, she looks under the carpet under her feet and find a key, with which she enters the house to find a long hallway full of doors and an image of herself at the end, now with different clothes. Jepsen keeps opening different doors, only to find other hallways. The scene then cuts to a bedroom where she meets her love interest, and they make love together. Back to the hallway, Jepsen opens another door where she sees a video of her wedding with the same guy. It cuts again to the bedroom, when it's revealed that there is another woman in the bedroom who stares at them both with a sadness expression on her face. Then we see Jepsen and the love interest fighting outside of the house in the middle of rain, only to find out that he had actually cheated on her with that other woman and she had discovered at that moment. She runs outside of the house and goes back to the cab.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yptytp1485017320.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrZPftzdX5Y","strMusicVidDirector":"Colin Minihan","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"10833","intMusicVidLikes":"46","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"1","intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"1","intScore":"7.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"72336","intTotalPlays":"601578","strMusicBrainzID":"ab76e72b-75f1-4949-b56b-175e1eee72d2","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"e7ce6cac-d26e-470c-b8a1-97ecc07354df","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"09887aa7-226e-4ecc-9a0c-02d2ae5777e1","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32882211","idAlbum":"2122843","idArtist":"112627","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Good Time","strAlbum":"Kiss","strArtist":"Carly Rae Jepsen","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"205000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Good Time\" is a song by American synthpop artist Owl City and Canadian artist Carly Rae Jepsen.
