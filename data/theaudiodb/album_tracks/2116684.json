Recorded for their debut studio album Fallen (2003), Wind-up Records released it as the album's second single on 2003. The song was written by Evanescence members Amy Lee, David Hodges and Ben Moody while its production was handled by Dave Fortman. The song contains rock and heavy metal elements and its instrumentation consists of drums and guitars built around Lee's soprano vocals. Lyrically, \"Going Under\" was written about an emotionally difficult past relationship. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised its anthemic chorus and Lee's vocal performance. \"Going Under\" peaked at number five on the US Billboard Alternative Songs chart, charted in the top ten in Brazil, Italy, New Zealand and the UK and the top forty in various other European countries and Australia. It obtained a platinum certification in the latter country by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).\n\nA music video for the song was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl and it was filmed in May 2003 in Berlin. It features the band performing the song live, while spectators from the audience turn into zombies and water in which lead singer Lee drowns, illustrating the song's lyrics of sinking. The singer designed both of the dresses she wears in the video.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdhqVtpR2ts","strMusicVidDirector":"Philipp St\u00f6lzl","strMusicVidCompany":"Oil Factory","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uqtuvy1475833224.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"136791658","intMusicVidLikes":"717503","intMusicVidDislikes":"20060","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"34344","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"0","intScore":"9.2","intScoreVotes":"10","intTotalListeners":"779743","intTotalPlays":"5659903","strMusicBrainzID":"afdd18a5-3fd8-4407-93e9-8445298aaf6f","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"2187d248-1a3b-35d0-a4ec-bead586ff547","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"f4a31f0a-51dd-4fa7-986d-3095c40c5ed9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32802755","idAlbum":"2116684","idArtist":"111766","idLyric":"165554","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Bring Me to Life","strAlbum":"Fallen","strArtist":"Evanescence","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"237293","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":"Troubled","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Bring Me to Life\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence. It was written by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Wind-up released \"Bring Me to Life\" in 2003 as the lead single from Evanescence's debut studio album, Fallen. The song delivers genres from alternative metal to rap rock and gothic metal among others.\n\nAccording to Lee, \"Bring Me to Life\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist's life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, critics praising the melody of the song, Lee's vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy.\n\nFollowing the inclusion of \"Bring Me to Life\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \"Bring Me to Life\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts.\n\nThe band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \"Bring Me to Life\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Bring Me to Life\" was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl. After the success of the video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, St\u00f6lzl said: \"On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the  soundtrack background of the song. I did not know if I would have to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul's arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong.\"\n\nThe video begins with Amy Lee dressed in a grey nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are performing in another room as Lee awakens and makes her way to the window. Lee exits the room out of the window and proceeds to climb up the side of the building with the wind blowing her hair and nightgown until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge she was previously standing on. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qpuspp1359577552.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxaaGgTQYM","strMusicVidDirector":"Philipp St\u00f6lzl","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wvxwyr1475831591.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"612902159","intMusicVidLikes":"4216026","intMusicVidDislikes":"115763","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"197682","intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"10","intTotalListeners":"1165058","intTotalPlays":"8990329","strMusicBrainzID":"c24eb26a-04d6-4f09-9449-9bc334f78ede","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"2187d248-1a3b-35d0-a4ec-bead586ff547","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"f4a31f0a-51dd-4fa7-986d-3095c40c5ed9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32802756","idAlbum":"2116684","idArtist":"111766","idLyric":"165555","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Everybody's Fool","strAlbum":"Fallen","strArtist":"Evanescence","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"195880","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":"Troubled","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Everybody's Fool\" is a nu metal song by American rock band Evanescence. Wind-up Records released the song on June 7, 2004, as the fourth and final single from their debut studio album, Fallen. It was written by Amy Lee and Ben Moody and it was produced by Dave Fortman. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who strip and sell their bodies instead of music to their listeners. Inspired by her sister's love for music artists who had false images, Lee wrote the song five years before the release of the album.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Everybody's Fool\" was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004.\n\nBefore the music begins, Lee appears with blond hair, a baby-blue blouse and a long white skirt and emerges from the kitchen holding a fresh-from-the-oven frozen pizza, in a TV commercial. She presents the pizza to her family and, as the camera zooms in for a close-up, the brand name on the pizza box is visible and it is called \"Lies\". \"There is nothing better than a good lie,\" Lee says cheerily, through a smile. Scenes of Lee in her hotel room follow as she removes her makeup. Those scenes are followed by Lee with \"luxurious auburn tresses and dangling diamond earrings\" as she plays a glamorous spokesmodel who violently scribbles and scratches out her picture in magazines after the photo shoot has finished. She also portrays a motorcycle girl in a commercial who drinks a soft drink called \"Lies\" that affords its drinker the opportunity to \"Be somebody.\"\n\nIn a Japanese-style commercial, with both Japanese and English texts, she plays a Barbie-like doll with pink hair, promoting a doll called \"Sweet Little Lie\". Each scene ends with Lee crying. During the bridge, two girls in an elevator are seen laughing at the model's appearance, stating that she looks much older than they thought she was. Next scene, she is shown in a bathtub singing the song to herself. Another segment shows her breaking a mirror with her bare hand, which starts to bleed uncontrollably. In the final scene, she stands on the balcony of a building, crying and screaming at a billboard featuring one of her advertisements, saying that the model side of her isn't \"real and you can't save me\", and that the public is oblivious to how she really lives.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhC1pI76Rqo","strMusicVidDirector":"Philipp St\u00f6lzl","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ruwwvs1475833798.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"90998662","intMusicVidLikes":"481189","intMusicVidDislikes":"9851","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"26664","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"9","intScoreVotes":"7","intTotalListeners":"548036","intTotalPlays":"4005755","strMusicBrainzID":"540c2151-e260-407c-9b13-5833158c210e","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"2187d248-1a3b-35d0-a4ec-bead586ff547","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"f4a31f0a-51dd-4fa7-986d-3095c40c5ed9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32802757","idAlbum":"2116684","idArtist":"111766","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"My Immortal (album version)","strAlbum":"Fallen","strArtist":"Evanescence","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"264213","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":"Troubled","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"My Immortal\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence from their debut studio album Fallen (2003). It was released by Wind-up Records on December 8, 2003, as the third single from the album. The song was written by guitarist Ben Moody, lead singer Amy Lee and keyboardist David Hodges, and it was produced by Moody and Dave Fortman. Various versions of \"My Immortal\" were recorded; one of them was included on the demo album Origin (2000) and another on the EP release Mystary (2003). The version originally appearing on Origin was later included on Fallen, featuring piano with backing strings. The version of the song released as a single was dubbed the \"band version\" because of the complete band's performance of the bridge and final chorus of the song.\n\n\"My Immortal\" is a piano power ballad written in slow tempo. Lyrically, it talks about \"a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone.\" Critical reception towards the song was positive, with critics complimenting its piano melody. In 2005 it received a nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Grammy Awards. The song was also commercially successful, peaking within the top ten in more than ten countries. It also peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, Greece and the US Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was certified gold in the United States, and platinum in Australia.\n\nAn accompanying music video directed by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona on October 10, 2003. The video shows Lee sitting and singing on various locations, but never touching the ground. Shots of Moody are also shown but he is never together with his band or Lee. The video was nominated in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was performed by the band during their three concert tours: the Fallen Tour (2003), The Open Door Tour (2007) and the Evanescence Tour (2011-12). It was also performed live during some of their television appearances and award ceremonies such as the Billboard Music Awards.","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5anLPw0Efmo","strMusicVidDirector":"David
