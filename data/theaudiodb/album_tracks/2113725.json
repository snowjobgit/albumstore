It was released as a digital download in the United Kingdom on 12 June 2011, serving as the lead single from his Lava Records/Atlantic Records debut album, +. The song debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, with sales of 57,607 copies.\n\nMusically, \"The A Team\" is a folk ballad with lyrics that speak of a crack-addicted prostitute (crack is known as a \"Class A drug\"). It was written after Sheeran visited a homeless shelter and heard some of the stories of the lives people had been living. Making the song upbeat was Sheeran's way of masking the heavy subject matter. Also using the term \"Class A Team\" was another way of masking it a little more. Sheeran wrote the song following a last-minute performance at an event for the homeless. The chorus of \"The A Team\" was also used by Sheeran in the track \"Little Lady\", which features Mikill Pane. It is available on No. 5 Collaborations Project.\n\nThe song received acclaim from critics, praising the lyrics and production as well as Sheeran's vocal performance. \"The A Team\" became a top 10 hit in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The song was serviced to U.S. radio formats in late 2012 and became a sleeper hit within the United States, gradually rising up the Billboard Hot 100 to peak at number 16 \u2013 becoming Sheeran's first single on that chart. On 5 December the song received a Grammy Award nomination for Song of the Year, Sheeran's first Grammy nomination.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xpvsqq1488543963.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWcs5H-qgQ","strMusicVidDirector":"Ruskin Kyle","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"319185908","intMusicVidLikes":"1391482","intMusicVidDislikes":"33373","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"71832","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"3","intScore":"9.66667","intScoreVotes":"6","intTotalListeners":"662814","intTotalPlays":"5724296","strMusicBrainzID":"17eb8cd6-7bb0-4579-90af-dc38c1b3fc6a","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"05ce100c-eddf-4967-8d7e-33fc0883fe39","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32767149","idAlbum":"2113725","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Drunk","strAlbum":"+","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"199000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Philosophical","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Drunk\" is a song by British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.

The official music video, released on 23 January 2012 features a cat who takes Ed out and gets him drunk to distract him from a break-up. The girl in the video, is the singer supporting him on his recent tour, Nina Nesbitt. This happens to be his first music video that he fully starred in. Another video was released several days before made by his cousin. The music video featured a mash up of clips from his UK tour.\n\nA music video was released for the song on 20 January 2012 with Nina Nesbitt and currently has over 20 million views on YouTube. The video, written and directed by Saman Kesh, starts with Sheeran coming home and sitting down on the couch, depressed. As he opens a can of beer, he notices his cat talking to him. Together they drink beer and do various activities, and later they go to a pub. Sheeran and his cat are kicked out when a person takes a photo of Sheeran and his cat starts a fight with that person. They bring several women and cats home to party and Sheeran starts hallucinating from his intoxication. The video ends with Sheeran waking up on the same couch with his cat next to him and a can of beer on the table. Throughout the video, Sheeran continues to have flashbacks of a particular woman and looks depressed immediately after, implying that she is Sheeran's ex-girlfriend who recently broke up with him.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vwytqx1515670268.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2fOum_KWQU","strMusicVidDirector":"Saman Kesh","strMusicVidCompany":"Pulse UK","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/qtvwtv1378073977.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/qqqpqs1378073985.jpg","strMusicVidScreen3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/tuyspw1378073995.jpg","intMusicVidViews":"105195879","intMusicVidLikes":"459700","intMusicVidDislikes":"8528","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"32835","intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"307684","intTotalPlays":"2433465","strMusicBrainzID":"dca0d867-2861-4b35-b309-897d8169edf7","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"05ce100c-eddf-4967-8d7e-33fc0883fe39","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32767150","idAlbum":"2113725","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"U.N.I.","strAlbum":"+","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"229000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Philosophical","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"0","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"0","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":"208435","intTotalPlays":"1379829","strMusicBrainzID":"c1a486fb-223a-4e3d-b6fc-19def43155a5","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"05ce100c-eddf-4967-8d7e-33fc0883fe39","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32767151","idAlbum":"2113725","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Grade 8","strAlbum":"+","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"181000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"ca8bc972-15fe-4e2e-82dc-e578f88e64a4","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"05ce100c-eddf-4967-8d7e-33fc0883fe39","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32767152","idAlbum":"2113725","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Wake Me Up","strAlbum":"+","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"229000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"5","intLoved":"0","intScore":"8","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"207064","intTotalPlays":"1351185","strMusicBrainzID":"904d88cd-b119-4a0b-b3da-2bef6e2972f9","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"05ce100c-eddf-4967-8d7e-33fc0883fe39","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32767153","idAlbum":"2113725","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Small Bump","strAlbum":"+","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"259000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Philosophical","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Small Bump\" is a song by British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, released as the fifth single from his debut studio album, +.

It stars actor Rupert Grint and was directed by Emil Nava. It was released on 20 October 2011 on Sheeran's YouTube channel.\n\nThe video's narrative at first portrays Grint as Sheeran, performing such activities as writing lyrics for the song on a pad of paper, lounging in his tour bus, and ultimately taking the stage for a cheering crowd. However, after Grint takes the stage and he is immediately tackled by security, it is slowly revealed that Grint is actually stalking Sheeran and is an obsessive fan, and that the events of the video were actually him stalking the real Ed Sheeran with increasing severity and mental instability (writing the song was actually transcribing the lyrics from the album cover, and lounging in the bus was him breaking into it), ending with Sheeran and Grint meeting as Grint is forcibly removed from a music venue and Sheeran comes out of a lift.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yuywyp1484320856.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4BLVznuWnU","strMusicVidDirector":"Emil Nava","strMusicVidCompany":"Pulse Films","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"272033031","intMusicVidLikes":"1422556","intMusicVidDislikes":"27447","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"156298","intTrackNumber":"9","intLoved":"2","intScore":"9","intScoreVotes":"3","intTotalListeners":"421449","intTotalPlays":"3620678","strMusicBrainzID":"28e418ee-9fb6-49e0-9f75-03184a09083b","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"05ce100c-eddf-4967-8d7e-33fc0883fe39","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32767157","idAlbum":"2113725","idArtist":"111611","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"You Need Me, I Don't Need You","strAlbum":"+","strArtist":"Ed Sheeran","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"220000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":"Philosophical","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\", or \"You Need Me\", is a song by British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.

It was released as the sixth and final single from his debut studio album + on 21 November 2012. The song was written by Sheeran, Jake Gosling and Chris Leonard. The single has thus far peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was used in the episode 14 (\"Dangerous Liaisons\") of season 3 of The CW series The Vampire Diaries, was used in the episode 5660 of series Home and Away and was used in the episode 6 of season 4 of Cougar Town.\n\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Give Me Love\" was directed by Emil Nava and released onto YouTube on 9 November 2012, at a total length of four minutes and twenty-six seconds. The video stars Australian actress Isabel Lucas. The video deals with the idea of Cupid.\n\nInterpretation: The girl (Isabel Lucas) has always had these preconceived notions of love; she understands it, she gets it, she\u2019s capable of it but no one will love her back. She is someone so full of love, maybe too much love, but has no one to love her back. So she sets out to find it. She starts to literally build and create the kind of person she wants to love and when that\u2019s not enough she goes out looking for it wherever she can find it. she becomes a cupid of some sort shooting down anyone before she even knows if they\u2019re capable of loving her back. But her attempts fail, making her feel worse because everyone around seems to be finding the one thing she\u2019s looking for without trying. She becomes greedy and is blinded by the false reality of love, believing that anyone can give it to her. She\u2019s down and desperate, finding anyone and anything that can give her the \u201chigh\u201d of love, turning to the grimy night time scene, where she \u201cshoots\u201d (stabs) everything. When all her attempts fail she is broken, done with finding love, it kills her she shoots herself believing that she\u2019ll be by herself forever. But when she least expects it- Love finds her, literally awakens her and opens her eyes.That is, her true love (Christian Kinde) comes in to take a closer look at the crime scene. The overriding message of this music video is in short, love comes to those who wait and least expect it.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rvsrry1378074350.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOjdXSrtUxA","strMusicVidDirector":"Emil Nava","strMusicVidCompany":"Pulse Films","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"603790716","intMusicVidLikes":"2612460","intMusicVidDislikes":"78654","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"89863","intTrackNumber":"12","intLoved":"1","intScore":"8.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"348218","intTotalPlays":"2933177","strMusicBrainzID":"88468681-111f-4c95-886d-77069c9b68c5","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"05ce100c-eddf-4967-8d7e-33fc0883fe39","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"b8a7c51f-362c-4dcb-a259-bc6e0095f0a6","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
