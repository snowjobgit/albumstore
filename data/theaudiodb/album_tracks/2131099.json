The song appears as the ninth track on the album. The song peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Rock Songs chart.\n\n\"Bleeding Out\" runs at 84 beats per minute. The song, compared to the former half of the Night Visions album, is one of Imagine Dragons' darker songs, and like most of the songs on Night Visions, it makes use of the Bass drum to set the overall tone and mood of the song. The song incorporates a jagged-edge production effect, where the guitar chords are separately recorded and mixed separately from the recording itself. When chords in the song are not repeated and flow through, the recording plays normally. However, if the chords repeat themselves, they literally repeat themselves in the recording as well to produce a broken record effect, as if the recording is skipping over itself. The song also makes use of synthesizer jabs to emphasize the belligerency of the song's atmosphere and mood. Also notable is that the lead-in unusually lasts three beats, unlike most songs where usually the lead-in would last two or a single beat before the song starts. \"Bleeding Out\" has been interpreted many ways, but with the consistent factor of sacrifice. Most agree that the song is about people giving all they have for another. They are willing to do everything in their power to protect this person and that includes \"bleeding out for .\"","strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"","strMusicVidDirector":"","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"0","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"0","intTrackNumber":"9","intLoved":"2","intScore":"9.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":"330530","intTotalPlays":"2330741","strMusicBrainzID":"4eb1b584-80be-493e-953e-a0c65c120b34","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"caef5f01-8568-4573-8458-c9e99ff7c734","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"012151a8-0f9a-44c9-997f-ebd68b5389f9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32982997","idAlbum":"2131099","idArtist":"114415","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Underdog","strAlbum":"Night Visions","strArtist":"Imagine Dragons","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"209440","strGenre":"Indie","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"10","intLoved":"0","intScore":"7","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":"217756","intTotalPlays":"1179559","strMusicBrainzID":"80b82002-46c4-46e6-ba8f-a7ae9c56f8ac","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"caef5f01-8568-4573-8458-c9e99ff7c734","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"012151a8-0f9a-44c9-997f-ebd68b5389f9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32982998","idAlbum":"2131099","idArtist":"114415","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Nothing Left to Say / Rocks","strAlbum":"Night Visions","strArtist":"Imagine Dragons","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"536080","strGenre":"Indie","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"11","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":"127146","intTotalPlays":"715525","strMusicBrainzID":"97ab1b6a-162e-4251-b8d5-a60eba9aae3c","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"caef5f01-8568-4573-8458-c9e99ff7c734","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"012151a8-0f9a-44c9-997f-ebd68b5389f9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32982999","idAlbum":"2131099","idArtist":"114415","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Selene","strAlbum":"Night Visions","strArtist":"Imagine Dragons","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"242000","strGenre":"Indie","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"12","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":"121307","intTotalPlays":"596565","strMusicBrainzID":"5e44032d-657b-4cd2-a81c-e9705bd80d54","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"caef5f01-8568-4573-8458-c9e99ff7c734","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"012151a8-0f9a-44c9-997f-ebd68b5389f9","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32983000","idAlbum":"2131099","idArtist":"114415","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"The River","strAlbum":"Night Visions","strArtist":"Imagine Dragons","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"204000","strGenre":"Indie","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"13","intLoved":"0","intScore":"7","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"74d091f8-139d-4dc3-bb3a-90c1fc68bad9","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"caef5f01-8568-4573-8458-c9e99ff7c734","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"012151a8-0f9a-44c9-997f-ebd68b5389f9","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
