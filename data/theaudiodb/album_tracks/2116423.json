It was released in November 1997 as the third and final single from the album The Fat of the Land. The song was voted by Mixmag readers as the third greatest dance record of all time. Although the song wasn't as big a commercial success as their previous singles, it gained a cult following.\n\nThe song caused considerable controversy because of its allegedly misogynistic title and its video, which depicted scenes of drunken and drug-fuelled sexual excess and violence.\n\nPrior to the release of the single, Liam Howlett was presented with three remixes of the title song, one by Jonny L, one by DJ Hype and one by Slacker. Howlett chose the DJ Hype remix to be released on the single. The Jonny L remix was released through a free CD that came along with the January issue of Muzik magazine in 1998, while the Slacker remix was never officially released, although it surfaced on a rare and limited set of white labels.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rysxxq1362651985.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJHVX_rKBHI","strMusicVidDirector":"Jonas \u00c5kerlund","strMusicVidCompany":"Oil Factory","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"156967","intMusicVidLikes":"1688","intMusicVidDislikes":"46","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"103","intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"4","intScore":"9.28571","intScoreVotes":"7","intTotalListeners":"649550","intTotalPlays":"3947670","strMusicBrainzID":"3752e069-27a6-4819-99d5-11aec26d90a7","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"ac9138ce-6331-3f8d-86d7-69f13e4ab4f4","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"4a4ee089-93b1-4470-af9a-6ff575d32704","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32799888","idAlbum":"2116423","idArtist":"112131","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Breathe","strAlbum":"The Fat of the Land","strArtist":"The Prodigy","strArtistAlternate":"Prodigy","intCD":null,"intDuration":"334800","strGenre":"Big Beat","strMood":"Angry","strStyle":"Electronic","strTheme":"Scary Music","strDescriptionEN":"\"Breathe\" is a song by English band The Prodigy.

It was the first single from their third album The Fat of the Land, and their tenth single. It was also the group's first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart, staying on top for three weeks, and their first big international hit, also reaching number one in Finland and Norway. It featured Flint's punky vocals which showcased him as the group's frontman. The title and lyrics were subject of controversy in the UK because of their violent nature. The music video further boosted these controversies.\n\nThe songwriting credits\u2014among Liam Howlett and Keith Flint\u2014include Kim Deal of alt-rock group The Breeders. The looped wah-wah guitar riff in \"Firestarter\" was sampled from The Breeders' track \"S.O.S.\" from the album Last Splash. Because of the use of a sample from a 1984 single \"Close (to the Edit)\" songwriting credits also list Art of Noise's then-members: Anne Dudley, Trevor Horn, J.J. Jeczalik, Gary Langan and Paul Morley. The \"Empirion Mix,\" which does not include these samples, is credited solely to Howlett and Flint.\n\nThe music video was directed by Walter Stern and was filmed in an abandoned London Underground tunnel at Aldwych. Keith Flint's appearance and the video's stark black and white also instigated controversies about being too scary for children watching it. Some television channels even refused to show the video until after the watershed.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tptxyx1362654430.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmin5WkOuPw","strMusicVidDirector":"Walter Stern","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uwspts1527154385.jpg","strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"13323187","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"8","intLoved":"3","intScore":"9.83333","intScoreVotes":"6","intTotalListeners":"560234","intTotalPlays":"3060070","strMusicBrainzID":"3dabfc40-33b4-4dba-8d94-79e77c4d1448","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"ac9138ce-6331-3f8d-86d7-69f13e4ab4f4","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"4a4ee089-93b1-4470-af9a-6ff575d32704","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32799895","idAlbum":"2116423","idArtist":"112131","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Climbatize","strAlbum":"The Fat of the Land","strArtist":"The Prodigy","strArtistAlternate":"Prodigy","intCD":null,"intDuration":"396893","strGenre":"Big Beat","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"9","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6.5","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"6b224a56-f932-4e31-ab78-5d5b4e9a4d92","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"ac9138ce-6331-3f8d-86d7-69f13e4ab4f4","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"4a4ee089-93b1-4470-af9a-6ff575d32704","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32799896","idAlbum":"2116423","idArtist":"112131","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Fuel My Fire","strAlbum":"The Fat of the Land","strArtist":"The Prodigy","strArtistAlternate":"Prodigy","intCD":null,"intDuration":"258906","strGenre":"Big Beat","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"10","intLoved":"1","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"2","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"83fe377d-2b58-4a02-a779-02fbb7b35644","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"ac9138ce-6331-3f8d-86d7-69f13e4ab4f4","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"4a4ee089-93b1-4470-af9a-6ff575d32704","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
