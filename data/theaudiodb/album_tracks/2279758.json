It was released on 25 January 2016 as the second single from their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams (2015). The song was written by the members of Coldplay and produced by Rik Simpson, Tim Bergling, Digital Divide, and Stargate.\n\n\"Hymn for the Weekend\" has reached number six on the UK Singles Chart and also reached the top twenty in countries such as Switzerland, Ireland, France, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Italy and Spain. In the US, with the Seeb remix, the song reached number 25 on the US Billboard Hot 100. A music video for the song was released on 29 January 2016 and features Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 in various cities in India.\n\nThe song was debuted on Annie Mac's BBC radio show on 30 November 2015, and Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman dialed in after the song aired to talk about his brush with royalty. According to Berryman, lead singer Chris Martin originally wanted the song to be a party song with the lyrics \"drinks on me, drinks on me\", but fortunately his bandmates didn't think that would go well with their fans. Martin's longtime friend Beyonc\u00e9 was asked to sing on the song, and she accepted the request.\n\nMartin corroborated Berryman's story about the band protesting him singing, \"Drinks on me, drinks on me\" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. According to Martin, the original kernel was that he \"was listening to Flo Rida or something\", and he thought, \"it's such a shame that Coldplay could never have one of those late-night club songs, like \"Turn Down for What\". I thought I\u2019d like to have a song called 'Drinks on Me' where you sit on the side of a club and buy everyone drinks because you're so fucking cool,\" Martin recalled. \"I was chuckling about that, when this melody came, 'drinks on me, drinks on me', then the rest of the song came out. I presented it to the rest of the band and they said, 'We love this song, but there's no way you can sing \"drinks on me.\"' So that changed into 'drink from me' and the idea of having an angelic person in your life. Then that turned into asking Beyonc\u00e9 to sing on it.\"\n\n\"Hymn for the Weekend\" is written in the key of C minor set in a 4\n4 time signature at a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute.\n\nAccording to The Times of India, the video was shot in October 2015 at various Indian cities including Varanasi, Worli Village, Mumbai and Kolkata. The fort showcased at the start and in between is Bassein Fort aka Saint Sebastian's Fort located in Vasai, Mumbai. The video was also shot at the famous Maratha Mandir theatre which is reputed for showcasing a single film for 15 straight years. The video is themed on the North Indian festival of Holi. The video was filmed by Ben Mor, and was released on 29 January 2016. The video features Beyonc\u00e9 and Indian actress Sonam Kapoor.\n\nThe music video was criticized on Indian social media network for its stereotypical portrayal of Indian society.\n\nIt has over 730 million views as of May 2017, becoming the most viewed music video for both Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xurwxs1495702849.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YykjpeuMNEk","strMusicVidDirector":"Ben Mor","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"1250670032","intMusicVidLikes":"7053697","intMusicVidDislikes":"218460","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"264743","intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"1","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"ea9f40ba-837a-4bf9-96a2-0639d98beb06","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"27da3ef8-f3b0-47bf-898d-9bdf4af7fc04","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34793129","idAlbum":"2279758","idArtist":"111239","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Everglow","strAlbum":"A Head Full of Dreams","strArtist":"Coldplay","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"282693","strGenre":null,"strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"313e6da7-7505-484e-90cb-988a214f12fc","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"27da3ef8-f3b0-47bf-898d-9bdf4af7fc04","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"34793130","idAlbum":"2279758","idArtist":"111239","idLyric":null,"idIMVDB":"0","strTrack":"Adventure of a Lifetime","strAlbum":"A Head Full of Dreams","strArtist":"Coldplay","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"263786","strGenre":"Alternative Rock","strMood":"Happy","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strTheme":"...","strDescriptionEN":"\"Adventure of a Lifetime\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 6 November 2015 as the lead single from their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams (2015).\n\n\"Adventure of a Lifetime\" reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the top 20 in a number of countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Switzerland.\n\nThe official music video was directed by the band's long-time collaborator, Mat Whitecross. It was released on 27 November 2015. The concept for the video was hatched after Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and British motion capture expert/actor Andy Serkis met on a plane and discussed ideas. It took about six months in the making of the music video.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the video was shot at The Imaginarium Studios, where the reboot series of Planet of the Apes and parts of Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars: The Force Awakens were filmed.\n\nHannah Clark, the producer of the video commented, \"As creatures go, chimps are one of the more difficult to animate. Not only are they quite human in their movement, but they are covered in hair. Add to this that we had no backgrounds shot, and we were asking an awful lot of any post-collaborator.\" The band's faces were covered in a special, reflective and light-catching make-up that allowed the computers to appropriately interpret the video feed and create renders of the chimpanzees' characters. The band members weren't playing real instruments, but similarly-shaped objects that enabled creation of realistic body positions.\n\nThe animation, visual effects and motion design of the video was carried out by Mathematic \u2013 a Paris-based production company. Mat Whitecross filmed the band using a special camera. Each of band members also wore a head-mounted camera system that was configured into a three camera solution. The camera systems provided multiple video streams from which the production team was able to recreate 3D points.\n\nThe CGI animated video features a group of music-loving chimpanzees that come across a Beats Pill speaker under a pile of leaves. The primates then discover the power of music and form a band that resembles the band members.\n\nThe video begins with a similar layout with Coldplay's 2011 music video, \"Paradise\". As it opens, four chimpanzees (played by the band members) are sitting in a forest. The opening verses begin after a chimpanzee (played by Jonny Buckland) find a portable speaker under a pile of leaves while it's playing the song. Another chimpanzee (played by Chris Martin) listens to the music and calls the rest of the group (played by Guy Berryman and Will Champion) to gather. It then slaps its chest and jumps to a path inside the forest alone.\n\nThe character sings the song and swings on the willow tree vines. Then, the four chimpanzees dance together during the chorus. After the chorus, they find an electric guitar, a bass and a drum set. The chimpanzees bang on the instruments before they realize their proper use. The characters play the instruments and form an \"ape band\". A hat is added on Buckland's character and an earring is added on Berryman's character after they have formed a band.\n\nDuring the bridge of the song, the band is surrounded by other chimpanzees (also played by themselves). The rest of the video features the dance movements of the other chimpanzees and the performance of the ape band. At the end of the video, Martin's character climbs up to a tree and overlooks the view of the forest which also features some Indian temples, a reference to the Indian inspiration of the associated album, A Head Full of Dreams.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/utxyrx1495702750.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtXby3twMmI","strMusicVidDirector":"Mat
