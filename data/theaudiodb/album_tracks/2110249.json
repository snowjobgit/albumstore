In the United States, \"Dreams\" was released as the second single from Rumours on March 24, 1977, while in the United Kingdom it was released as the third single in June 1977. A performance of \"Dreams\" on stage was used as the promotional music video.\n\nIn the US, \"Dreams\" reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, the band's only number-one single there; it sold over a million copies. In Canada, \"Dreams\" also reached number one on the RPM Top 100 Singles chart.\n\nBackground and composition\nThe members of Fleetwood Mac were experiencing emotional upheavals while recording the Rumours album. Mick Fleetwood was going through a divorce. Christine McVie was separating from her husband John McVie. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their eight-year relationship. \"We had to go through this elaborate exercise of denial,\" explained Buckingham to Blender magazine, \"keeping our personal feelings in one corner of the room while trying to be professional in the other.\"\n\nNicks wrote the song in early 1976 at the Record Plant studio in Sausalito, California. \"One day when I wasn't required in the main studio,\" remembers Nicks to Blender magazine, \"I took a Fender Rhodes piano and went into another studio that was said to belong to Sly Stone, of Sly and the Family Stone. It was a black-and-red room, with a sunken pit in the middle where there was a piano, and a big black-velvet bed with Victorian drapes.\"\n\n\"I sat down on the bed with my keyboard in front of me,\" continues Nicks. \"I found a drum pattern, switched my little cassette player on and wrote 'Dreams' in about 10 minutes. Right away I liked the fact that I was doing something with a dance beat, because that made it a little unusual for me.\"\n\nWhen Nicks played the song to the rest of the group, \"They weren't nuts about it. But I said 'Please! Please record this song, at least try it'. Because the way I play things sometimes... you really have to listen.\" The band recorded it the following day. Only a basic track was recorded at Sausalito. Recording assistant Cris Morris remembers that \"all (they) kept was the drum track and live vocal from Stevie \u2013 the guitars and bass were added later in Los Angeles.\" Christine McVie described the song as having \"just three chords and one note in the left hand\" and \"boring\" when Nicks played a rough version on the piano. McVie changed her mind after Buckingham \"fashioned three sections out of identical chords, making each section sound completely different. He created the impression that there's a thread running through the whole thing.\"","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/6nyzyt1601801523.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"Now here you go again\nYou say you want your freedom\nWell
