It also charted at number 10 on the Australian charts and number 35 on the UK Singles chart.\n\nThe music video features as a restaurant employee washing dishes while listening to the Kiss hit single Rock and Roll All Nite, performed by Poison. The manager enters, turns off the radio, and delivers to the employee a scathing reprimand, reminding the employee that he's being paid \"to wash dishes, not to listen to that... that rock 'n' roll,\" and accusing him of \"moving in two speeds: slow, and stop.\" The manager exits, whereupon the employee abandons the dishes and kicks open a nearby door to reveal a concert hall stage, upon which the band then performs the song. When the song is over, the manager returns, discovering, to his surprise, that all the dishes are washed.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/sxsvqr1356104804.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC9P8-B42cA","strMusicVidDirector":"Marc Reshovsky","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"4185985","intMusicVidLikes":"17323","intMusicVidDislikes":"292","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":"9.8","intScoreVotes":"5","intTotalListeners":"122704","intTotalPlays":"527634","strMusicBrainzID":"d6be31e1-815c-436a-818f-63621422b265","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c36e18c3-e3e2-372f-a9f7-ec7aa4408d40","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"c79c43d4-cbed-4373-89ce-6560f62eb7d8","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32933744","idAlbum":"2126943","idArtist":"113811","idLyric":"394756","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Back to the Rocking Horse","strAlbum":"Open Up and Say...

The b-side of the seven inch was \"Bad to Be Good\".\n\nReleased as a single in 1988 on Capitol Records. it made #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #32 on the Mainstream rock charts, making it the only single from the album not to reach the Top Ten. It also charted at number 21 on the Australian charts and number 59 on the UK Singles chart\n\nThe song is about a young girl who grew up in a small town and goes to Los Angeles to try to make it as an actress. While there she abandons her old life...\n\nThis theme is a reference to the history of the band Poison itself: Bret Michaels, Bobby Dall and Rikki Rockett all left their native Pennsylvania for Los Angeles in their quest of fame.\n\nThe song, along with \"Talk Dirty to Me,\" \"I Won't Forget You\" and \"Ride the Wind,\" was the subject of a lawsuit in 2011 by members of the defunct band Kid Rocker, who claimed that the songs were based on Kid Rocker songs played to Poison guitarist C.C. DeVille before he was a member of Poison.\n\nThe music video to \"Fallen Angel\" mostly follows the lyrics to the song, and was in heavy rotation on MTV. In the video, an unnamed girl (played by model and then aspiring singer/actress Susie Hatton, who was dating Michaels at the time) tells her family that she is leaving for California at the end of the week. She arrives in Los Angeles with a suitcase in tow. The girl eventually catches the eye of a guy (played by veteran character actor Anthony James) who manages a modeling agency and who offers her a job. She becomes a success, but feels like she is selling out her morals for fame. The girl and the manager start dating, but when he starts getting friendly with other ladies at a party, she leaves. He tries to get her back, but the girl gives him a kick in the groin, and walks off. She is back on the streets, but is picked up by Bret Michaels on a motorcycle and rides off into an unknown future. As her story ends, another girl, played by Michelle Davis, arrives in Hollywood hoping to find fame and fortune.\n\n","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uxtvvq1356105055.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdlEMmAFfIM","strMusicVidDirector":"Marty Callner","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"4599778","intMusicVidLikes":"9674","intMusicVidDislikes":"293","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"7","intLoved":"1","intScore":"8.5","intScoreVotes":"4","intTotalListeners":"87922","intTotalPlays":"394332","strMusicBrainzID":"6eb24e82-4ee8-4b3b-ac3c-8bc88056857d","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c36e18c3-e3e2-372f-a9f7-ec7aa4408d40","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"c79c43d4-cbed-4373-89ce-6560f62eb7d8","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32933749","idAlbum":"2126943","idArtist":"113811","idLyric":"394725","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Every Rose Has Its Thorn","strAlbum":"Open Up and Say...

It was released in October 1988 as the third single from Poison's second album Open Up And Say... Ahh!. It is the band's only number-one hit in the U.S., reaching the top spot on Christmas Eve in 1988 for three weeks (carrying over into 1989) and it also charted at #11 on the Mainstream Rock charts. It was a number 13 hit in the UK. \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\" was named number 34 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\", #100 on their \"100 Greatest Love Songs\" and #7 on MTV and VH1 \"Top 25 Power Ballads.\"\n\nMusically, the song starts quietly and features two intricate guitar solos, one mellow and one fast. Among guitarists, the song is notable for epitomizing the standard G - Cadd9 progression in pop/rock. During the same period, Poison had been playing at a cowboy bar called \"The Ritz\" in Dallas, Texas, accounting for the song's recognizable references to cowboys in the chorus, along with the twang in Bret Michaels' vocals, which give the song a country feel not often heard in power ballads composed by glam metal bands.\n\nIn an interview with VH1's Behind The Music, Michaels said the inspiration for the song came from a night when he was in a laundromat waiting for his clothes to dry, and called his girlfriend on a pay phone. Michaels said he heard a male voice in the background and was devastated; he said he went into the laundromat and wrote \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\" as a result. The name of the girl in the song is Tracy Lewis.\n\nThe music video to \"Every Rose\" was similar to those filmed for other 1980s power ballads. It features Michaels sitting down, playing the guitar, and singing along to the song, interspersed with black-and-white clips from concerts, and color frames of a storyline that follows the song.\n\n\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\" became the group's first (and only to date) number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100; it climbed to the top during the two last weeks of 1988 and the first week of 1989.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rxqput1356105318.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c56vEgA4fjU","strMusicVidDirector":"Marty Callner","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"14003869","intMusicVidLikes":"53178","intMusicVidDislikes":"784","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"8","intLoved":"1","intScore":"8.83333","intScoreVotes":"6","intTotalListeners":"244150","intTotalPlays":"1023043","strMusicBrainzID":"10c3b563-2135-4eee-9926-83c0eca65017","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c36e18c3-e3e2-372f-a9f7-ec7aa4408d40","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"c79c43d4-cbed-4373-89ce-6560f62eb7d8","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32933750","idAlbum":"2126943","idArtist":"113811","idLyric":"394736","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Your Mama Don't Dance","strAlbum":"Open Up and Say...
