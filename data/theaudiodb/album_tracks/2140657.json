The song caused controversy before the single's release due to its perceptional mocking of Christianity, which some Christians considered obscene.\nIt was released as a white-square-shaped vinyl 45, as a 'limited' edition release. Both sides featured the track. The single reached 179 on the UK Singles Chart. The music video debuted on May 8, 2013. It was directed by Floria Sigismondi, who also directed the video for the preceding single, \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\", and features English actor Gary Oldman and Academy Award winning actress Marion Cotillard, along with David Bowie. Bowie plays a Christ-like figure while Oldman acts the role of a bishop. The video depicts Bowie performing in a bar called The Decameron - reference to the Boccaccio's masterpiece known also for its satirical depiction of clergymen - and populated with religious figures and half-naked women. The video also portrays Marion Cotillard's character (who is presumed to be a prostitute) suffering from a gruesome stigmata, with the detailed depiction of the blood bursting from her wounds, while the priest is dancing with her. Other horror elements such as eyeballs served as food are also present. The music video ends with the stigmatized woman apparently born again as an innocent girl and Bowie saying simply, \"Thank you Gary, thank you Marion, thank you everyone.\"","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qvprsr1379323150.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wL9NUZRZ4I","strMusicVidDirector":"Floria Sigismondi","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"2189065","intMusicVidLikes":"25647","intMusicVidDislikes":"2127","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"1","intLoved":"1","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"54096aea-51b1-47c5-a0c5-4d034362535b","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c20be759-d767-4a7c-96c5-7a870ebc3a30","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33100981","idAlbum":"2140657","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Dirty Boys","strAlbum":"The Next Day","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"178000","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"1","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"59e37b88-e122-4de3-8d5a-f2498edb0b14","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c20be759-d767-4a7c-96c5-7a870ebc3a30","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33100982","idAlbum":"2140657","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)","strAlbum":"The Next Day","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"236000","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\" is a song by English musician David Bowie; it serves as the second single from his twenty-fourth studio album The Next Day.

However, on the morning of his sixty-sixth birthday, Where Are We Now? appeared on iTunes, along with information about Bowie's upcoming new album The Next Day. The release was unusual in that it was issued with no promotion, with fans discovering the existence of the single themselves. The news was widely reported and the single received much radio airplay, quickly topping the iTunes downloads chart and eventually charting at sixth in the UK Singles Chart. Despite the media attention surrounding the surprise release, Bowie made no media appearances whatsoever, with producer Tony Visconti instead taking media requests and accepting an interviewer's suggestion that he was Bowie's \"voice on earth\".","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vvswpx1379323361.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWtsV50_-p4","strMusicVidDirector":"Tony Oursler","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"4718495","intMusicVidLikes":"29516","intMusicVidDislikes":"1207","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"5","intLoved":"1","intScore":"7","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"8b1fb6d4-a6d7-44d9-8b9f-fedf7bab62ed","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"c20be759-d767-4a7c-96c5-7a870ebc3a30","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"5441c29d-3602-4898-b1a1-b77fa23b8e50","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"33100985","idAlbum":"2140657","idArtist":"111444","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Valentine's Day","strAlbum":"The Next Day","strArtist":"David Bowie","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"181000","strGenre":"Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Valentine's Day\" is a song by English rock musician David Bowie, the fourth single from his 24th studio album The Next Day.
