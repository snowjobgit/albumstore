It was officially released to radio in 2008. It peaked at #51 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in July 2009. The song has also charted on the Canadian Hot 100, peaking at #37.\n\nThis song is the theme song for the 2009 reality television program Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami. The \"New York\" version was used for the 2011 reality television program Kourtney and Kim Take New York. The song was also featured in a 2009 commercial on A&E Network advertising the show CSI: Miami.\n\nThe song title also varies by location (see Alternate versions). Because of this the song is often referred to as \"I'm in (Your City) Trick/Bitch\". The critical reception for the song is negative.\n\nIn addition to the many alternate versions of the song, there is a remix of the original version which features Pitbull. Internationally, the mashup with \"Let the Bass Kick\" by Chuckie is more popular (named \"Let the Bass Kick in Miami Bitch/Girl\"). This version was released as a single and entered the charts in the United Kingdom at #9, its peak position in that country.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vvtruw1359320027.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBRhoB5V_fA","strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"31246360","intMusicVidLikes":"61711","intMusicVidDislikes":"4086","intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"2","intLoved":"0","intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"3","intTotalListeners":"145383","intTotalPlays":"692370","strMusicBrainzID":"e03c2c20-29c6-442d-ac76-aab9403d8277","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0049d656-b017-4406-907f-509001221e2d","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"ed5d9086-e8cd-473a-b96c-d81ad6c98f0d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32832370","idAlbum":"2119012","idArtist":"112524","idLyric":"300243","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Get Crazy","strAlbum":"Party Rock","strArtist":"LMFAO","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"226000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"3","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":"108814","intTotalPlays":"410509","strMusicBrainzID":"d30aa4a1-c2fb-4194-8dbd-ec1e57848713","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0049d656-b017-4406-907f-509001221e2d","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"ed5d9086-e8cd-473a-b96c-d81ad6c98f0d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32832371","idAlbum":"2119012","idArtist":"112524","idLyric":"0","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Lil Hipster Girl","strAlbum":"Party Rock","strArtist":"LMFAO","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"202000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"4","intLoved":"0","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"9b86f781-c9a5-4241-9096-b410bbdbd473","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"0049d656-b017-4406-907f-509001221e2d","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"ed5d9086-e8cd-473a-b96c-d81ad6c98f0d","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32832372","idAlbum":"2119012","idArtist":"112524","idLyric":"300248","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"La La La","strAlbum":"Party Rock","strArtist":"LMFAO","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"211000","strGenre":"Pop","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"La La La\" is a song performed by American electro recording duo LMFAO.
