The music video for the song has Bret Michaels dancing with a couple of animated neon cowgirls next to him.\n\nThe meaning of \"Unskinny Bop\" has always been shrouded in obscurity. C.C. DeVille later confessed that the phrase \"unskinny bop\" has no particular meaning. He invented it as a temporary measure while writing the song, before vocalist Bret Michaels had begun working on the lyrics. The phrase was used on the basis that it was phonetically suited to the music. The song was later played to producer Fairbairn, who stated that, although he did not know what an \"unskinny bop\" was, the phrase was perfect.","strTrackThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qqppur1356106063.jpg","strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":"","strMusicVid":"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2r7ivh","strMusicVidDirector":"Marty Callner","strMusicVidCompany":"","strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":"0","intMusicVidLikes":"0","intMusicVidDislikes":"0","intMusicVidFavorites":"0","intMusicVidComments":"0","intTrackNumber":"5","intLoved":"5","intScore":"9.33333","intScoreVotes":"6","intTotalListeners":"133477","intTotalPlays":"482036","strMusicBrainzID":"f73090e1-87e0-4fbd-b2ca-949ff7b69b0c","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"f119385d-c478-3762-9bfe-7a751b58f493","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"c79c43d4-cbed-4373-89ce-6560f62eb7d8","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32933773","idAlbum":"2126945","idArtist":"113811","idLyric":"394740","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Let It Play","strAlbum":"Flesh & Blood","strArtist":"Poison","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"261960","strGenre":"Hard Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strTrackThumb":null,"strTrack3DCase":null,"strTrackLyrics":null,"strMusicVid":null,"strMusicVidDirector":null,"strMusicVidCompany":null,"strMusicVidScreen1":null,"strMusicVidScreen2":null,"strMusicVidScreen3":null,"intMusicVidViews":null,"intMusicVidLikes":null,"intMusicVidDislikes":null,"intMusicVidFavorites":null,"intMusicVidComments":null,"intTrackNumber":"6","intLoved":"0","intScore":"6","intScoreVotes":"1","intTotalListeners":null,"intTotalPlays":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"12ce39ec-8566-4a2a-adfe-16024002283c","strMusicBrainzAlbumID":"f119385d-c478-3762-9bfe-7a751b58f493","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"c79c43d4-cbed-4373-89ce-6560f62eb7d8","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTrack":"32933774","idAlbum":"2126945","idArtist":"113811","idLyric":"394728","idIMVDB":null,"strTrack":"Life Goes On","strAlbum":"Flesh & Blood","strArtist":"Poison","strArtistAlternate":null,"intCD":null,"intDuration":"287173","strGenre":"Hard Rock","strMood":null,"strStyle":null,"strTheme":null,"strDescriptionEN":"\"Life Goes On\" is a song by American glam metal band Poison.
