The album is noted for a blend of regular rock and acoustic rock tracks with shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles employed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work. Grohl tried to focus on songs with messages that resonated on the audience, writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from the birth of his daughter.\n\nCritical reception to Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was mostly positive, with praise to the sonic variety and songwriting, though some reviewers found the record inconsistent and uninspired. The album topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Austria, and had three successful singles, \"The Pretender\", \"Long Road to Ruin\" and \"Let It Die\".

In a 2006 interview, Dave Grohl states that the album is \"totally based on melody\" and that it \"might be his favorite album that they've ever done.\"\nEarly pressings of the disc included a temporary tattoo, similar to the one featured on the album cover. The album was also re-released in 2001 in Australia as a two-CD edition which offers a second VCD disc of four videos and one bonus track, \"Fraternity.\" This Australian edition has a picture of the Australian swimmer Michael Klim on the front, wearing the temporary \"FF\" tattoo on his shoulder.

The album was recorded on a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics dealt with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election.\n\nThe promotional tour for the album included both rock shows on stadiums and acoustic gigs on smaller venues.

Grohl claimed he recorded the album just for fun, describing it as a cathartic experience to recover from the death of his Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain.\nAfter Grohl completed the recordings, he picked up the name \"Foo Fighters\" to hide his identity and passed cassettes copies of the sessions to personal friends.

The album is considered by many to be the band's magnum opus.\n\nThe album was in total nominated for five MTV Video Music Awards in 1997 and 1998, for the videos \"Monkey Wrench\" and \"Everlong\". It was also a Grammy Award nominee for Best Rock Album in 1998.\n\nThe album was the debut of Foo Fighters as a band, as frontman Dave Grohl had recorded all of the first album by himself with the exception of one guitar part by Greg Dulli. The Colour and the Shape was produced by Gil Norton, who was perhaps best known for his work with the Pixies. Norton was very demanding of the band's performance, eventually leading bassist Nate Mendel to enhance his musical formation. Grohl stated that he wanted to go back to the studio as \"we didn't want people to feel [the Foo Fighters] were just another side project.\" The songs on the record were composed during sound checks during the extensive touring that the band went through for the previous eighteen months.

It was released on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records. As frontman Dave Grohl wanted a record that would capture the essence of the band's earlier work and lack the artificiality of digital recording, the group recorded in Grohl's garage in Encino, California with only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments in the previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, and Fee Waybill.\nThe recording sessions were documented for fans on the band's website and Twitter, and the album's promotion included the documentary Back and Forth and a worldwide concert tour that included concerts played in fans' garages. Wasting Light was preceded by the successful single \"Rope\", which became only the second song ever to debut at number one on Billboard's Rock Songs chart, and follow-up \"Walk\" also charted highly. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in eleven countries, and it received positive reviews from most music critics, who complimented its production and the band's songwriting. In 2012, Wasting Light and its songs earned Foo Fighters four Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album."},

Released in 1979, it is considered experimental, primarily due to Lindsey Buckingham's sparser songwriting arrangements and the influence of punk rock and New Wave on his production techniques. Bassist John McVie has commented that the album sounds like \"the work of three solo artists\" (Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie), whilst Mick Fleetwood later proclaimed that it is his favourite and the best Fleetwood Mac studio album created by the group. Costing over one million dollars to record (a fact widely noted in the 1979 press), it was the most expensive rock album made up to that point.\nTusk peaked at #4 in the US and was certified double platinum for shipping two million copies. It peaked at #1 in the UK and achieved a Platinum award for shipments in excess of 300,000 copies. The album gave the group two US top-ten hit singles, with the Buckingham-penned title track (US #8/UK #6), and the Stevie Nicks composition \"Sara\" (US #7/UK #37). Further releases from the album, \"Not That Funny\" (UK only single release), \"Think About Me\" and \"Sisters of the Moon\" were less successful; however, the latter two appear in their 'single versions' on the 2002 compilation The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. \"Sara\" was cut to 4Â½ minutes for both the single and the first CD release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the 1988 Greatest Hits compilation and the 2004 reissue of Tusk as well as Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions for Tusk, but his playing on the Christine McVie track \"Brown Eyes\" is not credited on the album.\nThough the album sold four million copies worldwide, in comparison to the huge sales of Rumours and the unprecedented recording expense, the band's record label deemed the project a failure, laying the blame squarely with Buckingham himself. Fleetwood, however, blames the album's relative failure on the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping. In addition, Tusk was a double album, with a high list price of $15.98.\nThe band embarked on a huge 18-month tour to promote Tusk. They travelled extensively across the world, including the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany they shared the bill with reggae superstar Bob Marley. It was on this world tour that the band recorded music for the Fleetwood Mac Live album, which was released at the end of 1980."},

Largely recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Don't Stop\", \"Dreams\", and \"You Make Loving Fun\" were released as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide.\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions."},

McVie is featured on three songs, which had been originally recorded for an unreleased Lindsey Buckingham solo album (tracks 2, 13 & 14). It also marks the first studio album in 16 years to feature Buckingham as a full member.\nSay You Will was the first Fleetwood Mac studio album to peak in the top 3 in the US since 1982's Mirage.

It was the band's second eponymous album; the first was their 1968 album. This is the first Fleetwood Mac album to feature Lindsey Buckingham as guitarist and Stevie Nicks as vocalist, after Bob Welch departed the band in late 1974.\nThe album reached number one on the Billboard 200 over a year after entering the chart. It launched three top twenty singles: \"Over My Head\", \"Rhiannon\" and \"Say You Love Me\", the last two falling just short of the top ten, both at No. 11. In 1976, it was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA representing shipments of five million units.\nUntil the release of this album, Fleetwood Mac's albums generally sold around 300,000 - 350,000 copies apiece. This album helped launch them as musical superstars with an almost constant radio presence (which would be continued with their even more popular follow-up, Rumours). In 2003, the album was ranked No. 183 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nIn Britain, the album was initially largely ignored and the first three singles lifted from the album failed to chart, therefore, generating limited interest in the album and the new line-up of the band. Only \"Say You Love Me\" charted on the UK Singles Chart and it reached No. 40. With the massive success of Rumours in 1977 and interest in the band re-ignited, Fleetwood Mac was issued again in 1978, along with the re-release of \"Rhiannon\" which peaked just outside the Top 40 at No. 46. The album eventually peaked at #23 on the UK Album Chart but was a prelude to a run of hugely successful albums for the band in Britain, including four multi-platinum number ones: Rumours, Tusk, Tango in the Night and Behind the Mask."},

It is clear that Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, and co-producers Karl Richardson and Albhy Galuten remembered Rogers' pop roots with the First Edition and, despite the country twang of \"Buried Treasure,\" the slick musicianship and modulation are not your typical country & western. There are four tracks written by Barry and Maurice and five more by Barry, Maurice, and brother Robin Gibb, including the stunning number one hit from September 1983, \"Islands in the Stream.\" It hit number one across the board on adult contemporary, country, and the Top 40, and deservedly so -- the melody is infectious, impeccable, and perfectly recorded. Keep in mind this was five years after they created Frankie Valli's biggest-selling solo record, \"Grease\" -- the pairing of Dolly Parton with Rogers makes for an amazing vocal sound to carry the melody. \"Living With You\" features the Bee Gees -- it is Rogers fronting the Bee Gees, and why they didn't seek out more artists, new as well as established, to work their magic on is a pity. It's a lush setting for the country superstar, and as Barbara Streisand and Dionne Warwick enjoyed success thanks to this creative team, Eyes That See in the Dark stands as an important piece of the Rogers catalog and a really timeless recording. The Gatlin Brothers add their magic to \"Evening Star\" and \"Buried Treasure,\" and these elements bring the Barry Gibb/Richardson/Galuten thousand-tracks production down to earth. \"Evening Star\" doesn't have the complexities of Samantha Sang's \"Emotion,\" the producers being very careful to keep it simple, something they just weren't doing on all their other records. There are only ten tracks on Eyes That See in the Dark, Jimmie Haskell's strings the major instrument next to Rogers' sympathetic vocal performance. \"Midsummer Nights\" is co-authored by Barry Gibb and Galuten, making Barry the catalyst and driving force, as he is the only person with a hand in every tune. \"Midsummer Nights\" brings things back up after \"Hold Me,\" and it is more adult contemporary than country. It would have made a great single but, as it was, the opening track, \"This Woman,\" went Top 25 in early 1984, and by the end of that year Rogers would post his 27th Top 40 hit, ending a string started 16 years earlier in 1968. It isn't clear why they didn't, but the pretty Barry and Maurice Gibb tune \"I Will Always Love You\" (not to be confused with Parton's hit of the same name) and the title track certainly should have found some chart action as well. Eyes That See in the Dark is not the definitive Kenny Rogers album but, outside of greatest-hits packages, it is absolutely one of his most consistent and one of his best. "},

Toward the end of the decade, he formed his own label, Dreamcatcher, and began to spend more time constructing his albums, starting with the adult contemporary Across My Heart. Its follow-up, She Rides Wild Horses, continues in the same direction, albeit with a slightly stronger country influence than before. There aren't any of the All-4-One cameos that cluttered Across My Heart, and the song selection, while still a bit uneven, is stronger -- enough to give the impression that She Rides Wild Horses is some sort of a comeback. And in a way, it is. It's been a while since Rogers has delivered an album with as many appealing songs as he does here -- \"The Kind of Fool Love Makes,\" \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore,\" \"Let It Be Me,\" \"The Greatest,\" the title song -- and the sound of the record is smoothly pleasurable, even if it can get a little bland.

The album also produced three other hit singles, \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\" and \"In Bloom\". By January 1992, it had replaced Michael Jackson's album Dangerous at number one on the Billboard charts. The Recording Industry Association of America has certified the album Diamond (over 10 million copies shipped), and the album has sold over 30 million copies worldwide.

Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from the polished production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired producer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame.\nSoon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release the album in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable. Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the group was not fully satisfied with the sound Albini had captured. Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired Scott Litt to make minor changes to the album's sound and remix the singles \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\".\nUpon release, In Utero entered the Billboard 200 chart at number one and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from Nevermind. The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold 3.58 million copies in the United States alone."},

The album is regarded as quite negative and bleak; Cobain has claimed that most of the lyrics were written the night before recording while he was feeling \"pissed off\", and that he did not regard them highly. The recording of the album was financed by Jason Everman, who was credited as a guitarist but did not play on any songs.\nBleach was well received by critics, but failed to chart in the U.S. upon its original release. The album was re-released internationally by Geffen Records in 1992 following the success of Nirvana's second album, Nevermind (1991).

It was the last album released under Radiohead's six-album record contract with Parlophone.\n\nAfter two Radiohead albums incorporating electronica, jazz and 20th-century classical music influences, Hail to the Thief was seen as a return to a more conventional rock sound while maintaining electronic and jazz elements. Following difficult recording sessions for previous albums, the band worked deliberately quickly, employing a live, \"spontaneous\" approach, and cited the Beatles, the Pixies, Charlie Mingus, Can, New Order, Tubeway Army and Siouxsie and the Banshees as influences. George Orwell, Dante, and fairy tales influenced the lyrics, much of which were written in response to the \"War on Terror\" and the subsequent War in Afghanistan. Songwriter and vocalist Thom Yorke said the album addresses \"frustration and powerlessness and anger, and the huge gap between the people that put themselves in control and the people that allegedly voted for them.\"\n\nHail to the Thief debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and at number three in the United States, and produced three charting singles: \"There There\", \"Go to Sleep\" and \"2 + 2 = 5\". It was praised by critics, though many felt it was not Radiohead's strongest work, and it became the fifth consecutive Radiohead album to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

The physical editions were released through the band's Ticker Tape imprint on XL in the United Kingdom, TBD in the United States, and Hostess Entertainment in Japan.\n\nFollowing the painstaking recording and relatively conventional rock instrumentation of In Rainbows, Radiohead employed a more spontaneous process to develop The King of Limbs, sampling their own recordings with turntablist techniques inspired by DJing. The band provided little information on the album, not even a track listing, before its release, and did not discuss it in detail until nearly eight months later. Singer Thom Yorke described it as an expression of \"physical movements\" and \"wildness\"; the title King of Limbs possibly refers to an oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest, thought to be 1,000 years old.\nThe King of Limbs has the shortest running time and track listing of any Radiohead album. As with 2000's Kid A, no singles were released, though a music video was released for the track \"Lotus Flower\". It received mostly positive reviews from critics, though opinion was more divided than for In Rainbows. The King of Limbs was nominated for five categories in the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Music Album, and was named one of the best albums of 2011 by several music journals. It charted in the top ten in several countries and became a bestseller on vinyl.\n\nThe album was followed by the release of a remix album, TKOL RMX 1234567, and a live video, The King of Limbs – From the Basement."},

OK Computer was the first self-produced Radiohead album, with assistance from Nigel Godrich. Radiohead recorded the album in Oxfordshire and Bath between 1996 and early 1997, with most of the recording completed in the historic mansion St. Catherine's Court. The band made a deliberate attempt to distance themselves from the guitar-oriented, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and wide range of influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\n\nOn delivery to Capitol, label representatives lowered their sales estimates because the album was deemed uncommercial. Nevertheless, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became Radiohead's highest album entry on the American charts at the time, debuting at number 21 on the Billboard 200. Three songs from the album-\"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\" and \"No Surprises\"-were released as promotional singles. The album built on the band's worldwide popularity and has to date sold over 4.5 million copies.\n\nOK Computer received considerable acclaim upon release. Prominent British and American rock critics predicted the album was epochal and would have far-reaching cultural impact. In subsequent years, the album has been frequently cited by critics as one of the greatest albums ever recorded. OK Computer initiated a shift away from the height of Britpop's popularity to the more melancholic and atmospheric style of alternative rock prevalent in the next decade. Critics and fans often remark on the underlying themes found in the lyrics and artwork, emphasising Radiohead's views on rampant consumerism, social alienation and political malaise; in this capacity, OK Computer is often interpreted as having prescient insight into the mood of the 21st century. An LP reissue in 2008 contributed to a popular revival of vinyl records, and an expanded CD reissue in 2009, apparently released without the band's foreknowledge or permission, brought renewed attention to the album and its legacy."},

Featuring five charting singles, the album also marked the beginning of a shift in aesthetics and themes for the band, with greater use of keyboards, and more abrasive guitar tracks balancing subtler ones. The introspective grunge-influenced style of Pablo Honey evolved toward more multi-layered rock with cryptic lyrics and larger ideas, as the band and singer Thom Yorke reacted against the rigors of near-constant world tours. \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\", the final single and last song on the album, became their first top five UK hit.\n\nThe album was subject to greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), receiving an enthusiastic critical reaction, and it reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single \"Creep\" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88.

In the years since its release, the album has frequently appeared in listener polls and critics' lists of best contemporary rock albums.\n\nThe Bends was ranked at #110 on Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list."},

The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and recalls almost nothing of the production.\n\nMusically, Station to Station was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the funk and soul music of his previous release, Young Americans, while presenting a new direction towards synthesisers and motorik rhythms that was influenced by German electronic bands such as Kraftwerk and Neu!. This trend culminated in some of his most acclaimed work, the so-called Berlin Trilogy, recorded with Brian Eno in 1977–79. Bowie himself has said that Station to Station was \"a plea to come back to Europe for me\". The album’s lyrics reflected his preoccupations with Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, mythology and religion.\n\nWith its blend of funk and Krautrock, romantic balladry and occultism, Station to Station has been described as \"simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable\". Preceded by the single \"Golden Years\", it made the Top 5 in both the UK and US charts. In 2003, the album was ranked number 323 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."},

Bowie is quoted describing the album as \"the squashed remains of ethnic music as it survives in the age of Muzak rock, written and sung by a white limey\". Because of the strong influence of black music on the album, Bowie used the term \"plastic soul\" (originally coined by an unknown black musician in the 1960s) to describe the sound of Young Americans. Although Bowie was an English musician bringing up touchy American issues, the album was still very successful in the United States; the album itself reached the top ten in the US, with the song \"Fame\" hitting the number-one spot the same year the album was released."},

This was Bowie's final album for the EMI sub-label.\n\nA lot of the material that ended up on 'Hours...' was originally used, in alternate versions, for the video game Omikron: The Nomad Soul, which also featured two characters based on Bowie, as well as one on his wife Iman, one on 'Hours...' collaborator Reeves Gabrels, and one on bassist Gail Ann Dorsey.\n\nTo drum up interest in the impending album, a \"Cyber Song\" contest was held on Bowie's personal website BowieNet to compose lyrics to an early instrumental version of the song \"What's Really Happening.\" The winning lyrics would be featured on 'Hours...' . Contest winner Alex Grant also won a trip to Philip Glass' Looking Glass Studios on 24 May 1999 to watch Bowie record the final vocal during a live Webcast. There, Grant contributed backing vocals to the song, along with a friend who accompanied him. Bowie also gave a \"special creativity award\" to Derek Donovan of Love Among Puppets for his entry, which Donovan posted on the Web after combining elements of the original instrumental track with his own new recording.\n\nThe album cover, designed by Rex Ray with photography by Tim Bret Day and Frank Ockenfels, depicts the short-haired Bowie persona from the intensely energetic previous album Earthling exhausted, resting in the arms of a long-haired, more youthful version of Bowie. Indeed, 'Hours...' is a much mellower album than its predecessor, and features numerous references to earlier parts of Bowie's musical career (particularly the early 1970s). For the album's initial release, a number of copies featured a lenticular version of the cover, lending a three-dimensional effect to the image.\n\nAn edition with additional tracks was released in 2004. In January 2005, Bowie's new label ISO Records reissued 'Hours...' as a double CD set with the second CD comprising remixes, alternate versions, and single B-sides.\n\nIt was the first Bowie studio album to miss the US Top 40 since Ziggy Stardust and peaked at number 47."},

File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to their impact on artists that are dependent on record sales to continue their careers. Keenan said during an interview with NY Rock in 2000, \"I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs.\"\n\nA month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus; the name Systema Encéphale and the tracklist had been a ruse. Lateralus and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward art rock and progressive rock territory. Rolling Stone wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that \"Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent death march ... The prolonged running times of most of Lateralus' thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with suitelike purpose.\" Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club expressed his opinion that Lateralus, with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs—topped by the ten-and-a-half-minute music video for \"Parabola\"—posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.\n\nThe album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week. Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song \"Schism\".

According to Allmusic, Undertow helped heavy metal music remain prominent as a mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. It was released at a time when grunge was at the height of its popularity, and pop punk was slowly beginning to gather mainstream attention. Allmusic saw the album's success in the \"striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood.\" It was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA on May 14, 2001.\n\nAs of July 7, 2010, Undertow has sold 2,910,000 copies in the US.\n\nThe album was recorded between October and December 1992 at Grand Master Studios, Hollywood, California, by Sylvia Massy. Some of the songs featured on the album are songs that the band decided to not release on their first EP, Opiate.\nThe album art was designed by Adam Jones.Photos in the liner notes of a nude obese woman, a nude man of normal weight, and the band members with pins in the sides of their heads generated controversy, resulting in the album being removed from stores such as Kmart and Wal-Mart.The band reacted by releasing another version, which depicted a giant bar code on a white background.\n\nThis version of the album included a note from the band.\n\nThe message on the photographs of the band members reads \"Trust me trust me trust me trust me trust me I just want to start this over say you won't go this is love I'll make weapons out of my imperfections lay back and let me show you another way only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind cleanse and purge me in the water twice as loud as reason euphoria I've been far too sympathetic no one told you to come I hope it sucks you down life feeds on life this is necessary.\" This passage contains lyrics from all of the songs of the album.\n\nIn some versions of the album, when the black CD tray is removed from the case, a picture of a cow licking what appears to be its genital region is revealed. In other versions of the album, released internationally, the picture of the cow licking the genital region is viewable without problems under the transparent backing of the disc case. The photo of the cow is accredited in the album's liner notes to have been taken by Danielle Bregman. The ribcage is also on the front cover of the album, but the obese woman is absent from the booklet of the musical album, only the members of the band are depicted.\n\nAdam Jones' pet pig, Moe, appears on the back cover\namid an array of forks standing on end.\n\nComedian Bill Hicks is noted as \"inspiration\" in the liner notes. His presence would feature again on Tool's next album.\n\nChris Haskett, then with the Rollins Band, is credited in the liner notes with \"sledge hammer\", probably relating to the \"three pianos and shotguns smashed with sledgehammers\" on \"Disgustipated\".\nAdam Jones recalls a story in which the band purchased two second-hand pianos with the intention of blasting them with shotguns in the indoor parking lot of Grand Master Studio and putting the resulting sounds to tape. Apparently the man running the studio was happy as long as they cleaned up the mess afterwards. Since the incident, Tool has been approached by other bands claiming to have seen the shotgun holes left by them in the carpark wall."},

Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album's name was 10,000 Days. Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that 10,000 Days was merely a \"decoy\" album to fool audiences. The rumor was proven false when a leaked copy of the album was distributed via filesharing networks a week prior to its official release.\n\nThe album opener, \"Vicarious\", premiered on U.S. radio stations on April 17, 2006. The album premiered on May 2 in the U.S. and debuted at the top spots of various international charts. 10,000 Days sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was number one on the Billboard 200 charts, doubling the sales of Pearl Jam's self-titled album, its closest competitor. However, 10,000 Days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor Lateralus had been.\n\nAfter the release of 10,000 Days, a tour kicked off at Coachella on April 30. The touring schedule was similar to the Lateralus tour of 2001; supporting acts were Isis and Mastodon. During a short break early the next year, after touring Australia and New Zealand, drummer Carey suffered a biceps tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend's dog, casting uncertainty on the band's upcoming concerts in North America. Carey underwent surgery on February 21 and several performances had to be postponed. Back on tour by April, Tool appeared on June 15 as a headliner at the Bonnaroo Music Festival with a guest appearance from Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello on \"Lateralus\". Meanwhile, \"Vicarious\" was a nominee for Best Hard Rock Performance and 10,000 Days won Best Recording Package at the 49th Grammy Awards.

The album won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1998. In 2003, Ænima was ranked the 6th most influential album of all time by Kerrang! In 2006, it placed 14th on a Guitar World readers poll that attempted to find the best 100 guitar albums.\n\nThe title Ænima is a combination of the words 'anima' (Latin for 'soul' associated with the ideas of \"life force\" and a term often used by psychologist Carl Jung) and 'enema', the medical procedure.\nMusic videos were made for \"Stinkfist\" and \"Ænema\". Promotional singles were issued for \"H.\" and \"Forty Six & 2\". Several of the songs are short segues or interludes that connect to longer songs, pushing the total duration of the CD towards the maximum of around 80 minutes. These segues are \"Useful Idiot\", \"Message to Harry Manback\", \"Intermission\", \"Die Eier Von Satan\", \"Cesaro Summability\", and \"(-) Ions\".\nThemes of the album include Egyptian mythology in a seven-pointed star symbolizing Babalon, and sacred geometry in dividing the planet into grids related to chromosomes. The band dedicated the album to Bill Hicks (a comedian who the band felt was going in the same direction as them) and claimed this album to be partly inspired by him. The inside cover displays art featuring a painting of a disabled patient that shows a resemblance to singer Maynard James Keenan and Bill Hicks depicted as a doctor or \"healer\" with the line, \"Another Dead Hero\". Lines from Bill Hicks' standup set, \"One Good Drug Story\" and \"The War on Drugs\" are sampled before the song \"Third Eye\"."},

It was first released on 28 January 2008, through XL Recordings. Following Adele's graduation from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in May 2006, she began publishing songs and recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to interest from XL Recordings. This led to Adele signing a recording contract with the label and providing vocals for Jack Peñate, during this session for Peñate's song she met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album.\nAdele wrote most of the album's material solely, but did work with a select few writers and producers including Jim Abbiss, Eg White and Sacha Skarbek. Their collaborations created a blue-eyed soul album with lyrics describing heartbreak and relationship. Upon release, 19 received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the singer's vocals and noting her as having the \"potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" 19 was also won and was nominated for numerous accolades including a Mercury Prize, and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The second single, \"Chasing Pavements\" also won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.\n19 was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the UK charts during its release, and peaking at number four on the US Billboard 200 in 2012. The album is certified 7× Platinum in the UK, and 3× Platinum in the US. Worldwide sales for the album are at an estimated 10 million copies."},

It was released on 24 January 2011 in most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008–09 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\nAdele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.\nPraised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her indie record label XL Recordings and became a massive hit in 2011. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and appeared in the 2012 edition of Guinness World Records. In the United Kingdom, it is the best-selling album of the 21st century and fourth best-selling album of all time, while its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. In the United States, the album held the top position for 24 weeks, longer than any other album since 1985 and the longest by a female solo artist in Billboard 200 history, and was certified Diamond by the RIAA. It is one of the top 100 best-selling albums in the United States and earned the distinction of top Billboard 200 album of all time. Singles \"Rolling in the Deep\", \"Someone like You\" and \"Set Fire to the Rain\" became worldwide number-one hits, while \"Rumour Has It\" charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America.\nGlobally, 21 was the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012, and helped revitalise lagging sales of the UK and US music industry. By July 2014, the album had sold 30 million copies worldwide. Critics hailed the album as a shift from the overtly sexual and musically bombastic status quo, and attributed its success to its deeply autobiographical yet universal songs. Shortlisted for the 2011 Mercury Prize, 21 won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year."},

Her change in record label, and adoption of a pseudonymous surname accompanies a notable shift from the Christian gospel rock of her self-titled debut album. The album was released on June 17, 2008 by Capitol Music Group.\n\nThe album features the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"I Kissed a Girl\", as well as top three hit \"Hot n Cold\", top ten hit \"Waking Up in Vegas\", and top thirty hit \"Thinking of You\". The album earned Katy Perry two Grammy Award nominations in 2009 and 2010. One of the Boys has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.\n\nPerry has stated that she had been working on the album since she was eighteen years old. During the making of the album Perry was dropped from two record labels and went through two canceled albums. During this time, Perry had written close to seventy songs. Perry collaborated with notable producers Greg Wells, Dr. Luke, Dave Stewart, and Max Martin among others on the album. Perry co-wrote every song on the album as well as writing three of the songs herself.\n\nOnce signed to Capitol, label head Jason Flom started work on a new album by convincing Dr Luke to go back into the studio with Perry, with the two having already worked together on the abandoned Columbia sessions. Together with Max Martin they wrote and cut \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\". Perry then collaborated again with Greg Wells, who she'd also worked with on the Columbia album, creating the songs \"Ur So Gay\" and \"Mannequin\". According to Perry's A&R Chris Anokute they ended up with five new songs and then chose the six best songs from the shelved Columbia album to compile \"One of the Boys\". When talking about the songs on the album Perry said that she released the single \"Ur So Gay\" as an introduction to the album:\n\nThe album will have a lot of the same characteristics [as \"Ur So Gay\"], though. There will be lots of storytelling, because lyrics are important to me. There are a few songs that will make you cry, but there are others to make you dance and sing. Every song is on the album for a specific reason."},

Most of the songs were about Stride's lack of success in his love life, every disaster that could possibly befall a young man attempting to date girls, or being bored in a dead-end job, and were very highly repetitive in the lyric department, especially the hit single \"She's So Lovely\" (with its three-syllable \"love-er-ly\") and its nonchalant way of rhyming \"I love the way she makes me drool, I think she is beautiful.\" \"I Need a Holiday\" repeated the line \"I wish it could be Sunday when I wake up everyday\" over and over again, and \"The Airplane Song\" began with the unforgettable lyric \"She's a strawberry milkshake.\" The album ended with tributes to \"James Bond,\" particularly the Roger Moore incarnation, and Stride's boyhood crush on \"Michaela Strachen,\" reflecting on another girl who got away, as she broke his heart when he was just 12. A fun pop album with pleasant melodies, not unlike McFly or Busted."},

While Scouting for Girls garnered more than their fair share of disparagement from critics in the British press, there's no denying that the band proved remarkably successful from a commercial standpoint. Scouting for Girls (2007), the band's eponymous debut, topped the U.K. albums chart and spawned a trio of Top Ten hit singles (\"She's So Lovely,\" \"Elvis Ain't Dead,\" \"Heartbeat\"). In hopes of repeating the success of their debut album, Scouting for Girls took their time writing Everybody Wants to Be on TV. It was reported that bandleader Roy Stride scrapped an entire album's worth of material in 2008 and went back to the drawing board in his aim to write \"the perfect pop song.\" The problem is that the ten songs on Everybody Wants to Be on TV are too perfect. They're well-crafted, for sure, and practically all of them are primed for mainstream pop/rock radio play. Take for instance the lead single, \"This Ain't a Love Song,\" which shot straight to the top of the U.K. singles chart upon its release. Its appeal is immediate. One listen is all it takes. Unfortunately, in Stride's aim to write perfect pop songs and hitmaker Andy Green's bid to produce tunes as tailor-made for the charts as last time, the songs on Everybody Wants to Be on TV tend to resemble one another as the album advances. Give or take novelty touches like the Auto-Tune on \"Little Miss Naughty\" or some memorably clever turns of phrase on \"Posh Girls,\" these songs are interchangeable. Their charm wears thin with each passing track, and Stride's hit-making approach becomes increasingly plain in the process. In the end, it's something of a blessing that Everybody Wants to Be on TV is over and done with in a mere 34 minutes' time. Scouting for Girls are, at their best, as a singles act."},

They display maturity but also play with the fervor of kids and project a wide-eyed charm that is very endearing. On most of Inside In/Inside Out, the band sounds like a more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times. Along with these modern kinships and influences, the band is heavily indebted to classic rock. Traces of Thin Lizzy's romantic lyricism pop up on tracks like \"Eddie's Gun,\" and so does a bit of post-punk spikiness on \"You Don't Love Me,\" some Dexys singalong booziness on \"She Moves in Her Own Way,\" and a hint of jam-band funk on \"Match Box.\" Quite varied influences, and in the end the band sounds like The Kooks and no one else. A nice and unique sound doesn't mean much without some songs to fill it out, and The Kooks deliver plenty of memorable tunes. \"Eddie's Gun,\" \"See the World,\" the unfortunately named \"Jackie Big Tits,\" and \"Ooh La\" are very strong and, taken together, equal the output of just about any pop/rock band around in 2006. The only song that falls flat is the over-long reggae-rocker \"Time Awaits.\" It's the only track that breaks the four-minute mark, and it shows that The Kooks' strength isn't stretching out and jamming; their chops are best suited for short, sharp blasts of invigorating pop/rock. When they stick to that, The Kooks are an exciting, very promising band, and Inside In/Inside Out is an excellent debut."},

I’ve always found house music deeply absorbing; it forces you to be in the moment and it’s locked into my DNA. I get riled when dance music gets undervalued as mindless nonsense because there’s a galvanising force in people getting together to do something positive. There’s nothing more joyous than people dancing and losing themselves to music.\"\n\"What’s exciting is putting The Dance into context as our sixth album,\" adds Bliss. \"After getting together to do one single, we never thought we’d reach this point. It’s mad, innit? But it’s also very rare that you find a unique voice and when Rollo and me first encountered Maxi, we didn’t want the conversation to end. Our first record, Salva Mea, was very odd for 1990s dance music. The original is like a symphony that goes into hip hop then banging house - it’s all over the bloody shop."},

A precursory and experimental single, \"Memphis Bells\", was released in very limited numbers, followed by the traditional release of the single \"Girls\". The U.S. version of the studio album contained a bonus track; a remix of \"Girls\", entitled \"More Girls\". The album, which topped the UK Album Charts on its debut week, was promoted by a 2-year-long tour.\n\n5,000 digital copies of \"Memphis Bells\" were sold over the Internet. Each copy was a combination of customer-chosen instrumental, rhythmic, and melodic options, of which 39,600 choices were available. Five mixes were sold in three file formats, WAV, two audio mixes in MP3, and a 5.1 DTS surround sound mix, and all were free of digital rights management.\n\nIn 2005, they released a compilation, Their Law: The Singles 1990-2005, which spawned a single containing new remixes of the songs \"Out of Space\" (the \"Audio Bullys Remix\") and \"Voodoo People\" (the \"Pendulum Remix\"). The artwork represented drawn versions of the front covers of the \"Out of Space\" and \"Voodoo People\" single releases. The latter was also followed by a music video filmed in Romford Market, Essex, which featured on the DVD release of the compilation.

We didn't actually want to do the Greatest Hits, we were ready to start our new record-until the record company pointed out that it was in the contract. But then we got into it, and tried to be creative with it as much as [we could]. And, you know, we ended up being really proud of it. You have to have a different brain when you're doing a record like that.

In this year The Prodigy also headlined the prestigious Lollapalooza festival.\n\nThe long-awaited third Prodigy album, The Fat of the Land, was released in 1997, just as the band headlined the Glastonbury Festival on its opening night. Featuring simplified melodies, sparser sampling, less rave music influences, and punk-like vocals supplied by a shockingly madeover Flint, the album nevertheless retained the bone-jarring breaks and buzzsaw synths so idiomatic of the band. The album cemented the band's position as one of the most internationally successful acts in the dance genre, entering the UK and US charts at number one.\n\nThe Prodigy were getting considerable airplay on rock stations with their controversial track \"Smack My Bitch Up\"-and also a negative backlash for the song. The National Organization for Women (NOW) criticized the song and its music video. The song's lyrics consist entirely of the repeated phrase \"Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up\", which NOW stated are a \"dangerous and offensive message advocating violence against women\". Howlett responded to the criticism by stating that the meaning of the song and its lyrics were being misinterpreted, and the phrase meant \"doing anything intensely, like being on stage - going for extreme manic energy\". The band did not actually write the lyric, but rather, sampled it from the hip hop Ultramagnetic MCs' track \"Give the Drummer Some\" which also appears on the Dirtchamber Sessions; they had also sampled another Ultramagnetic MCs song \"Critical Beatdown\" on their earlier \"Out of Space\" single. The National Organization for Women also believed that the lyrics are in reference to administering heroin (smack) to another person. Several radio stations limited the song's airplay to nighttime hours. In September 1997, The Prodigy performed \"Breathe\" at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, and won the Viewer's Choice Award.\n\n\"Smack My Bitch Up\" The song generated an amount of controversy, and received backlash for the repeating sample.The music video for \"Smack My Bitch Up\", directed by Jonas Ã…kerlund, featured a first-person point of view of someone going clubbing and indulging in large amounts of drugs and alcohol. Other content shown includes the protagonist getting into fist fights with men, abusing women, vomiting repeatedly, and picking up a lap dancer (played by British glamour model Teresa May) and having sex with her. Much of the aforementioned is depicted fairly explicitly. At the end of the video, the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman. MTV only aired the video between 1 and 5 a.m due to the offensive material. After one week, the very same television network banned the music video at NOW's request. The director got the inspiration for the contents of the video after a night of drinking and partying in Copenhagen.\n\nDuring a performance at the Reading Festival on 29 August 1998, The Prodigy and the Beastie Boys had an onstage disagreement over the track, with the Beastie Boys requesting the song should be pulled from their set as it could be considered offensive to those who had suffered domestic abuse. Choosing to ignore the Beastie Boys plea, Maxim introduced \"Smack My Bitch Up\" with the declaration \"They didn't want us to play this fucking tune. But the way things go, I do what the fuck I want\".\n\nWal-Mart and Kmart later announced they would pull The Fat of the Land off their shelves. Despite the fact that the LP had resided on their store shelves for over 20 weeks, and the fact that they had sold 150,000 copies of the album in total, the two stores found the marketing campaign for the new single release \"offensive\". At the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles, \"Smack My Bitch Up\" won two awards; Best Dance Video and Breakthrough Video.\n1999 saw the release of The Prodigy's The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One, a DJ mix album by Howlett, produced as an official record of a successful guest appearance on the British Radio 1. In June of the same year, when the band had arguably reached their commercial peak, they parted company with guitarist Gizz Butt.\n\nFollowing 1999, Thornhill departed from the group while he divorced Sara Cox due to the risk of nervous breakdown, resulting in the band's website being replaced with their logo and the words \"We will be back\" set against a black background, a stint that it'd remain until 2002."},

The following year, The Prodigy's second album, Music for the Jilted Generation, debuted in the UK Albums Chart at number one, and jettisoned into positive reactions from album critics. Adding elements of big beat and electro-industrial to the mix, the album expressed a wider spectrum of musical styles, with heavy breakbeat-based tracks complemented by the concept sequence The Narcotic Suite and a rock-oriented inclination, \"Their Law\", featuring Pop Will Eat Itself.\n\nThe album was nominated for a Mercury Music Prize, although Howlett had reaffirmed his dedication to making The Prodigy a 'hard dance band', commercially successful but without compromise. The band managed to continue to prevent over-exposure in the media by refusing to appear on Top of the Pops or other television shows in the UK. To date, their only studio appearance on British television came when they appeared on the BBC2 series Dance Energy in 1991, performing \"Everybody in the Place\". In the ensuing years, their videos received a strong level of support by MTV Europe, which boosted their popularity across the continent. Keith Flint himself hosted an episode of the MTV show 120 Minutes in 1995.\n\nFollowing the international success of Music for the Jilted Generation, the band augmented their line-up with guitarist Jim Davies (a live band member who later joined the group Pitchshifter) in 1995 for tracks such as \"Their Law\", \"Break and Enter 95\", and various live-only interludes and versions.

It spawned four singles: \"Bring Me to Life\", \"My Immortal\", \"Going Under\", and \"Everybody's Fool\". \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"My Immortal\" peaked within the charts of more than ten countries, including Australia, United Kingdom, and the United States. The album earned the band five nominations at the 46th Grammy Awards: Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, Best Rock Song, Best Hard Rock Performance and Grammy Award for Best New Artist, winning Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance.\n\nAfter Evanescence was formed by Amy Lee and Ben Moody in 1995, the band released two extended plays (EP) and one demo CD and in January 2001 they signed with their first major label, Wind-up. The writing process for the album took a period of eight years. During an interview with MTV, Ben Moody revealed that he never wrote together with Lee adding, \"maybe two or three times in eight years did we actually sit down and write together in the same room.\"\n\nThe album was recorded at Track Record Inc. & NRG Recording Studios, Ocean Studios, Conway Recording Studios, all in California. Different tracks were recorded as demos before the album's recording sessions, while \"My Immortal\", \"Imaginary\", and \"Whisper\" appeared on the band's earlier material. The album was recorded and mixed between late August and early December, 2002. Recording work for Fallen started at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California, where most of \"Bring Me to Life\" was recorded for the Daredevil soundtrack, prior to full album production. For that song, Jay Baumgardner used a mix at his studio, NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, on an SSL 9000 J. Drum tracks were recorded at Ocean Studios, with Josh Freese playing to click-tracks, containing stereo guitars and vocals on selected songs.\n\nOn the rest of the drums, Fortman said that he used a D112 on the inside of the kick drum, a U47 on the outside, an NS-10 speaker as an outside mic. The producer ran 414s on the ride cymbal and hi-hat. He recorded the drums onto 2-inch tape on a Studer machine and then bounced the parts into Pro Tools. The guitars (Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, Mesa Boogie, Marshall Amplification) for the album were cut at Mad Dog Studios, Burbank, California in an old Mesa/Boogie cabinet. Lee's vocals, pianos and background vocal by The Millennium Choir were recorded in NRG Recording Studios. The orchestra parts were arranged by David Hodges and David Campbell, except in \"My Immortal,\" which was done by composer Graeme Revell. The mixing for the album took a period of two weeks at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood while the album was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City."},

In an interview with Paul Sexton of Billboard magazine, a marketing executive from Mercury described the challenge associated with promoting the album in the U.S. due to the evolution of the group's music: \"When you have a band like Swing Out Sister, you'd have a tough time pinpointing their sound. It's pop, it's urban, it's adult, it's jazz. Europe and Japan don't adhere to those rules as much as America does. It crosses over so many lines, and that's where Swing Out's strength is.\""},

Jackson, Rodney Jerkins, R. Kelly and Teddy Riley received producing and writing credits, among others. Similar to Jackson's previous material, Invincible explores themes such as love, romance, isolation, media criticism, and social issues. Invincible received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. The album's singles were incomplete in their release. Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.\nThree singles were released from the album: \"You Rock My World\", \"Cry\" and \"Butterflies\" of which the first and second were released as physical singles internationally (except the USA) and the third one being a US-only radio-airplay single. The album's first and last singles charted within the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, and they peaked at number one and within the top ten in several markets worldwide; \"Cry\" was less commercially successful. Following a conflict between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music stopped promoting the album. The album was the recipient of one Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male, as well as being voted, by readers of Billboard magazine, the best album of the decade.\nThe album peaked at number one in eleven territories worldwide, including the United States (with sales of 363,000 units its first week), the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Switzerland. Invincible charted within the top ten in six other territories; its least successful charting area was Mexico, where the album peaked at number twenty nine. Invincible re-entered music charts several times during the decade. Despite selling 13 million copies worldwide, the album has been viewed as a commercial failure compared to Jackson's previous albums sales."},

Lyrical themes expressed in the album included racism, poverty, paranoia, romance, the welfare of children and the world and self-improvement, topics Jackson had recorded before. Dangerous, much like Bad and Thriller, cemented Jackson's place in music history as one of the leaders of contemporary pop music.

The two singles released outside the United States was successful on the charts, charting within the top ten and top forty respectively.

The only songs not released were \"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\", \"She Drives Me Wild\", \"Keep the Faith\" and \"Dangerous\", a video and a single release for the latter song was said to have been planned but was postponed indefinitely due to the musician's tour and later personal problems.\nDangerous was the first album to be produced fully by Jackson, with additional production from his friend, Bill Bottrell and Teddy Riley, with production from the latter producer, presenting Jackson with a younger urban audience. Jackson composed on all but two tracks on the album. Dangerous won several Grammy nominations only winning one for Best Engineered Album (Non Classical) by Bruce Swedien and Riley. In addition to commercial success, the album also received critical acclaim from contemporary critics.

While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album. Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz Recording, Westlake Recording Studios, and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. Jackson collaborated with a number of other writers and performers such as Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. Five singles were released from the album. Three of the singles had music videos released. Jackson wrote several of the songs himself, including the Platinum-certified lead single, \"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough\". It was his first solo release under Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death in 2009.\nThe record was a departure from Jackson's previous work for Motown. Several critics observed that Off the Wall was crafted from funk, disco-pop, soft rock, jazz and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained positive reviews and won the singer his first Grammy Award since the early 1970s. With Off the Wall, Jackson became the first solo artist to have four singles from the same album peak inside the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. The album was a commercial success; to date it is certified for 8Ã— Multi-Platinum in the US and has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums of all time.\nOn October 16, 2001, a special edition reissue of Off the Wall was released by Sony Records.

Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off the Wall, including pop, R&B, rock, post-disco and adult contemporary music.\nRecording sessions took place between April and November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a production budget of $750,000, assisted by producer Quincy Jones. Of the nine tracks on the album, four of them were written by Jackson himself. Seven singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Three of the singles had music videos released. \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" were the only tracks that were not released as singles. In just over a year, Thriller became-and currently remains-the best-selling album of all time, with sales estimated by various sources as being between 65 and 110 million copies worldwide, and is also tied with Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) by the Eagles as the best-selling album in the United States. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys.\nThriller enabled Jackson to break down racial barriers via his appearances on MTV and meeting with President of the United States Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools-the videos for \"Thriller\", \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, a demo recording and the song \"Someone In the Dark\", which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, the album was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a previously unreleased song and a DVD.\nThriller ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in its Definitive 200 Albums of All Time.

Bad itself has sold between 30 to 45 million copies worldwide, shipped 8 million units in the United States alone, and has been cited as one of the best selling albums of all time. The album produced five Hot 100 number ones, the first album to do so. Similar to Jackson's previous music material, the album's music features elements of R&B, pop and rock.\n\nBad was recorded during the first half of 1987. The lyrical themes on the record relate to paranoia, romance and self-improvement. Bad is widely regarded as having cemented Jackson's status as one of the most successful artists of the 1980s, as well as enhancing his solo career and being one of the best musical projects of his career. Nine of the eleven songs on Bad were released as singles; one was a promotional single and another was released outside of the United States and Canada. Five of the singles hit number one in the United States, while a sixth charted within the top-ten, and a seventh charted within the top-twenty on the Hot 100. The single that was released outside of the United States and Canada was commercially successful, charting within the top ten and top twenty in multiple territories. Bad peaked at number one in seven countries, as well as charting within the top twenty in other territories. The only song on the album which wasn't released as a single nor had a music video for was \"Just Good Friends\".\n\nBad saw Jackson exercise even more artistic freedom than he did with his two previous Epic releases (Off the Wall and Thriller). On Bad, Jackson composed nine of the album's eleven tracks and received co-producer credit for the entire album. The album continued Jackson's commercial success in the late 1980s and garnered six Grammy Award nominations, winning two. Aside from commercial success the album also received critical acclaim from contemporary critics. Bad was ranked number 43 in the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time of the MTV Generation in 2009 by VH1 and number 202 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album marked the final collaboration between Jackson and producer Quincy Jones. In addition, Jackson scored five number ones from Bad, making him the first of only two artists in the chart's history to amass five number-one singles from one album. This feat would not be equaled for 23 years when Katy Perry did the same with her album Teenage Dream."},

Mirage yielded several hit singles: \"Hold Me\" (which peaked at #4 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Chart, remaining there for seven weeks), \"Love in Store\" (#22 US Pop Chart), \"Oh Diane\" (which reached #9 in the UK), and finally, \"Can't Go Back\" (issued on 7\" and 12\" in the UK).\n\nThe Stevie Nicks composition \"Gypsy\" (#12 Pop, #4 Rock, and a #1 hit in Canada) was the second single from the album and was accompanied by a lengthy video, the highest-budget music video ever produced at the time, directed by Russell Mulcahy, and was the very first \"World Premiere Video\" on MTV in 1982. The single and album edit of \"Gypsy\" ran for only 4:24, but a 5½-minute version had been originally recorded and it was this version used for the video. This full-length version was not made available on CD until 1992's retrospective box set 25 Years – The Chain.\n\nOf the other two compositions from Nicks on the album, \"That's Alright\" dated back to the Buckingham/Nicks days of 1974, whilst \"Straight Back\" was written in the winter of 1981 and referred to her separation from (then) lover, producer Jimmy Iovine, and the huge wrench she experienced having to leave her newly established and highly successful solo career to re-join Fleetwood Mac for the 1982 project (Nicks refers to this on the DVD commentary to her 2008 retrospective Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks). \"Straight Back\" was also a US radio hit in winter 1982.\n\nThe album was certified double platinum for shipping 2,000,000 copies in the US and returned the group to the top of the U.S. charts for the first time since their 1977 hit album Rumours, spending five weeks at the top. It also reached #5 in the UK where it was certified platinum for shipping 300,000 copies, and #2 in Australia. The album entered the 'Billboard top 200 albums chart' at #50, it then climbed to #9 the following week, #3 in its third week and began its five-week run at #1 in its fourth week. After five weeks at the top, in its ninth week it fell to #2 where it stayed for eleven weeks. In its twentieth week, the album fell to #13 and dropped to #14 the next week. In its twenty-second week, 'Mirage' plummeted to #33 and fell further the next week to #53. 'Mirage' spent 35 weeks in the top 100, 22 weeks in the top 40 and 19 weeks in the top 10."},

The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard charts and it sold over 7.2 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe album was recorded and mixed at Little Mountain Sound Studios, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Canadian producer Bruce Fairbairn and mixer Mike Fraser.\n\nThe front cover of the album featured the Poison logo and album title as a tattoo on Rikki Rockett's arm. The cover was originally planned to have a slightly different version of the tattoo cover that featured the tattoo after being freshly inked. This showed the skin as red and inflamed with dripping ink or blood. This cover was pulled though and instead a cleaned up tattoo was shown. The original cover was released for the initial pressing in Japan but was subsequently removed from all later pressings (including those in Japan). The record’s marketing reflected the end of the more extreme elements in Poison’s \"glam\" image, including its excessive make-up and teased, girlish hair (see Look What the Cat Dragged In), featuring a look similar to Guns N' Roses.\n\nParts of the album reflected a darker, more serious side to the band, touching themes such as hard times and overcoming them (\"Valley of Lost Souls\", \"Life Loves A Tragedy\", \"Come Hell Or High Water\"), missing loved ones (\"Life Goes On\"), long-term relationships (\"Don’t Give Up an Inch\", \"Ball and Chain\"), and disillusionment (\"Something to Believe In\"). The fun side of the band remained intact, however, in tracks dealing with sex (\"(Flesh & Blood) Sacrifice\", \"Unskinny Bop\"), exhilaration from music or motorbikes (\"Let It Play\", \"Ride the Wind\"), and tongue-in-cheek poverty (\"Poor Boy Blues\").\n\nThe meaning of \"Unskinny Bop\", one of the band's most popular songs, has always been shrouded in obscurity. DeVille later confessed that the phrase \"unskinny bop\" has no particular meaning. He invented it as a temporary measure while writing the song, before vocalist Bret Michaels had begun working on the lyrics. The phrase was used on the basis that it was phonetically suited to the music. The song was later played to producer Fairbairn, who stated that although he did not know what an \"unskinny bop\" was, the phrase was perfect.\n\nFlesh & Blood was voted Best Album in Circus magazine's 1990 Readers' Poll, while \"Something to Believe In\" was voted Best Single. The album was connected to three Metal Edge Readers' Choice Awards in 1990, when the magazine's readers voted it for Album of the Year and \"Something to Believe In\" for Song of the Year and Best Video.\n"},

However, very few contained them all and, as of 2004, the only collection in print that contained all his big hits, from the First Edition through the mid-'80s, was 1999's four-disc box set Through the Years, which was too exhaustive for all but dedicated Rogers fans. So, there was a need for a new, relatively concise collection that featured all the hits; hence Capitol's 42 Ultimate Hits, a double-disc set that spans Kenny's entire career, from the First Edition to two new tracks, including a duet with Whitney Duncan. There's not much missing -- a few First Edition singles, along with several post-Eyes That See in the Dark hits that weren't all that memorable, neither of which are missed -- and it could even be argued that it stretches a little bit too far into the present on its second disc, which loses its momentum halfway through. Nevertheless, these are minor complaints, since the bulk of the collection provides Kenny Rogers' biggest songs -- among them \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In),\" \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town,\" \"Lucille,\" \"Every Time Two Fools Collide,\" \"The Gambler,\" \"Coward of the County,\" \"You Decorated My Life,\" \"Lady,\" \"Love Will Turn You Around,\" and \"Islands in the Stream\" -- in a chronological order and a listenable sequence. It may fall a little short of definitive, but it's still the best compilation on the market as of this writing."},

The cover is a bit startling; who thought he'd ever age? He always looked like he was somewhere in his middle to late fifties. But that look is traceable if you look deep enough, while Rogers seems to wear his age proudly, like Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson. The disc sounds like a goodbye to all the illusions, regrettable mistakes, and foolhardiness brought by living into the wisdom brought by the golden years. Rogers' career has seen so many heights, it's dizzying to think about. And he's still hanging out on Capitol while many of his contemporaries are struggling on independent labels, if they're recording at all. Water & Bridges isn't a perfect record, but it's a sincere one, and there are many tracks here that no other singer could pull off. And to be truthful, as in his very best material, Rogers has this uncanny ability to make everything on this record sound like it came from his own pen. It's a melancholy record about passage, from one stage to the next, of life, of love, of youth, of ignorance, of spirit. The 11 tracks here are all slow, all reflective. It's that particular brand of slick, soft, modern country and pop that he does better than anyone. There is one true dud in the bunch called \"The Last Ten Years (Superman),\" which is merely a novelty song about all the famous ones who passed on in the last decade. But there are so many tracks here where one can hear the spirit of mortality railing against the dying of the light. There is the title cut, which opens the disc and charts generations of fathers hurting their sons both born and unborn, where the protagonist finds himself as guilty as anybody he's charged; \"Someone Is Me,\" about taking on civic responsibility; the killer \"Someone Somewhere Tonight,\" which finds magic in the mere presence of everyday life. Don Henley joins Rogers on \"Calling Me.\" It's a white man's country-soul tune that sounds too much like Curtis Mayfield's classic \"People Get Ready.\" (Litigants get ready, set, go!) The vocal performances are stellar. \"I Can Feel You Drifting\" is a fine pop song, and it's a true heartbreaker. In the now thinning grain of Rogers' awesome voice, all the emptiness and sorrow and confusion in the world comes to call. Water & Bridges is as good as anything out there in 2006 and a whole lot better than most of the dross Nash Vegas shovels out. Hopefully Rogers scores big one more time."},

Devotees will appreciate the classic AA sound in tunes like \"Cactus Blue\", \"The Wind of Change\" and \"Tuff Puzzle\", melodic pieces driven by Carmichael's nylon strings and his guitar partner Miles Gilderdale's steels.\n\nBut perhaps some of the most dazzling music on 'Aart' is in the more jazzy pieces, most notably \"Wish You Were Near\", \"Aart Attack\", and \"Robbie's Revenge\". A new sound for AA emerges in these tracks, a sonorous interplay between the twin guitars and a full-frontal horn section, with the likes of Jeff Kashiwa on sax. The new sound is full and fresh, while staying true to Acoustic Alchemy's roots. \"Flamoco Loco\" is a tongue-in-cheek look at the Latin sound which was so much a part of the band's early days, while \"The Velvet Swing\" shows a new maturity and passion in the group's songwriting.\n\nLong time fans will find something familiar to hold on to with 'Aart'; the spirit of Nick Webb lives on in the group. New fans, however, will find that Acoustic Alchemy definitely has something to offer with a more rounded sound and melodies that keep you spinning the disc. Whichever catagory you fall into, you won't be disappointed."},

The album was released in North America on 1 January 2008 on TBD Records. In Rainbows was Radiohead's first release after the end of their contract with EMI and the end of the longest gap between studio albums in their career.\n\nRecording with producer Nigel Godrich, Radiohead worked on In Rainbows for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in mid-2006. The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than other Radiohead albums, with singer Thom Yorke describing most tracks as his versions of \"seduction songs\". Radiohead incorporated a wide variety of musical styles and instruments, using not only electronic music and string arrangements, but also pianos, celestes, and the ondes Martenot.\n\nUpon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 at number one; by October 2008, it had sold more than three million copies worldwide in both digital and physical formats. The album earned widespread critical acclaim and was ranked as one of the best albums of 2007 by several publications. In 2009, it won two Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Special Limited Edition Package."},

The album, co-produced by the band with Paul Epworth along with returning Mylo Xyloto producers Daniel Green, and Rik Simpson, was released by Parlophone on 16 May 2014. The album was released by Atlantic Records in North America on 19 May 2014. It is the first full-length release by the band in North America under Atlantic, after Coldplay were transferred from Capitol Records in 2013, following the purchase of EMI and its assets by the Universal Music Group in 2012.\nGhost Stories, partly inspired by lead singer Chris Martin's troubled relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow at the time of the album's recording, is a concept album that tells the story of a man going through a dramatic and sudden breakup, with the narrative following the man's various emotional states leading up to his eventual acceptance of the situation. The album revolves around a central theme of \"opening yourself up to love\", and accepting that love does not last forever. The album was recorded by the band throughout 2012 and 2013 at the band's purpose-built home studios in London, England, and features guest producers Avicii, Timbaland and Madeon, in addition to the band's frequent collaborator, Jon Hopkins. The album is packaged with original etchings by Mila Fürstová, created specifically for the album.\nThe album was heavily promoted by the band and Parlophone in the lead-up to its release, with an accompanying prime time TV special, a visual album and a six-date promotional tour of the album, as well as various appearances on television and radio. The album was further promoted by three singles: \"Magic\", released in March, \"Midnight\", released in April, and \"A Sky Full of Stars\", released in May 2014.\nIn 2011, Coldplay released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto. Originally conceived by the band as a \"stripped-down, more acoustic collection\", it became one of Coldplay's most experimental and pop-oriented records to date, being described as \"luxuriously colourful\" where \"the choruses are bigger, the textures grander  the optimism more optimistic.\" Produced by Markus Dravs, Brian Eno, Rik Simpson and Dan Green, the album peaked at #1 on 18 national album charts and certified Platinum in 16 different countries. Mylo Xyloto had also sold 8 million copies within the first year of release. Coldplay's 2011 single, \"Paradise\", became the band's second UK #1 single after 2008's \"Viva la Vida\". Coldplay's subsequent world tour in promotion of Mylo Xyloto visited North America, Europe, Australasia and Africa, raising over 100 million in revenue.\nGoing into the creative process for their sixth studio album, the band wanted to return to the \"stripped-down, more acoustic collection\" they had stated their fifth album would be, returning to the original idea of an acoustic-oriented album, with less of the production and sound that made Mylo Xyloto."},

Its lead single, \"Sing\", was released as a digital download on 7 April 2014, becoming his first single in the UK to reach number 1. As soon as \"+\" was finished, Sheeran started work on his second studio album. Around the time his first album was released in 2011, the first songs for the second album were written, \"One\" being the album opener, and another which eventually became a bonus track. Sheeran wrote with Johnny McDaid from Snow Patrol in hotel rooms while supporting them on the North American leg of the band's Fallen Empires Tour in 2012. He also wrote with Irish singer/songwriter and frequent tourmate Foy Vance, penning multiple potential songs for the album. Sheeran decided against releasing his second album in 2012, deciding instead to follow in the footsteps of fellow British acts like Adele and One Direction who had \"broken America\".  In Autumn 2013, Sheeran performed three sold out nights at Madison Square Garden, finishing two and a half years on tour to focus on recording his new album.\n\nIn a behind the scenes tour video, it was revealed that he was in the studio with producers Rick Rubin and Pharrell Williams, who were later confirmed in interviews to be contributing towards the album. The album was due for release on 17 February 2014, but Sheeran got \"the opportunity to work with Rick Rubin for two months, which  wasn't going to say no to\", which led to a delay. Having written \"hundreds\" of songs, Sheeran entered the studio with Rubin and they cut that down to the 15 new songs that feature on the album, excluding \"I See Fire\", which was recorded separately and saw release on the soundtrack for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Sheeran stated that he \"started off making another acoustic record, and it turned into a neo-soul-funk record\", due to the influence of working with producers like Rubin and Benny Blanco that \"pulled  out of  comfort zone\". Getting into the studio with Rubin to \"rerecord all the songs\" after two years of writing them made the songs sound \"raw and interesting\", at a time when Sheeran was getting tired of them, giving him a chance to \"actually set up the album instead of just putting it out\". However, doing an entire album with Rubin \"just wouldn't work on pop radio\", so after working with Rubin he wrote the songs \"I'm a Mess\" and \"Thinking Out Loud\", both about his girlfriend at the time, with a different producer. Jake Gosling, who co-wrote and produced the majority of Sheeran's debut album, has no writing credits on this album, whilst new collaborators include Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody and British dance act, Rudimental."},

The album was released on March 3, 2014, through Williams' label i Am Other and Columbia Records. Girl is Williams' first studio album in eight years, following his 2006 debut, In My Mind. The album contains appearances by Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Daft Punk and Alicia Keys.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews from music critics. It peaked at number one in 12 countries worldwide, also charting in the top 10 of 17 other countries. The album has sold 519,521 copies in the United States as of September 17, 2014.\n\nThe album's lead single is the Academy Award-nominated song \"Happy\" (from the Despicable Me 2 soundtrack), which is a huge worldwide success, selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. Further singles \"Marilyn Monroe\", \"Come Get It Bae\" and \"Gust of Wind\" have achieved moderate success.\n\nAt the 57th Grammy Awards, the album is nominated for Album of the Year and Best Urban Contemporary Album. The track Happy was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Music Video.\nWilliams provided vocals for French duo Daft Punk's 2013 album Random Access Memories. After returning from the Paris recording sessions, he attended a meeting with record label managers, who said that the results were \"spectacular\" and that \"Get Lucky\" would be Daft Punk's next single. They also made Williams an offer to record his own album, to which he agreed quickly, \"overwhelmed that someone wanted to know what's in my heart.\"\n\nOn December 17, 2013, it was announced that Williams had signed to Columbia Records and would release his second studio album in 2014. In a December 2013, press release Rob Stringer, Chairman of Columbia Records, said, \"When we excitedly partnered with Pharrell in January of this year, we felt it was his time again. Since then, 'Blurred Lines' and 'Get Lucky' have defined pop music in 2013, and now we are preparing to launch Pharrell as a global solo superstar in 2014. 'Happy' is just the beginning.\"\n\nOn February 18, 2014, Williams unveiled a trailer for the album. The next day, he said in a statement, \"When Columbia Records presented me with the opportunity to make an album, three things came to mind, One was the sense of overwhelming honor that I felt when I realized that they were interested in partnering with me on the album that I had always dreamt of making. Two, it would have to feel festive and urgent. And three, I instantly knew it would be called G I R L. I hope you like it.\"\nCalled a feminist \"almost-concept\" album in early reviews, Girl is Williams' attempt to \"eliminate what he sees as an understandable degree of uncertainty over what his attitude to women actually is.\" He said that he felt the need to clarify himself in the wake of \"Blurred Lines\" controversy, as with the song's \"questionable lyrics, and the nature of the aesthetic of the video, it's easy to get confused about that.\" Williams also stated, \"There's an imbalance in society, in my opinion, and it's going to change. A world where 75 percent of it is run by women – that's a different world. That's gonna happen, and I want to be on the right side of it when it does.\"\n\nInterviewed by Zane Lowe backstage at the 2014 BRIT Awards, Williams specified that the capitalization and double-spacing of the album title is deliberately designed, \"Because when you look at it, it looks a little weird... Because society is a little unbalanced.\" He also added that he wished to honor the female figures that had been part of his life by making the record.\nThe opening track on the album, \"Marilyn Monroe\", begins with an orchestral string introduction. The song's production is characterized by Williams' signature \"skittering\" beat and \"bumping\" bass line, and its lyrics discuss \"helpless romantics and the perfect lady.\"\n\nThe album's first single, \"Happy\", is a neo soul and funk song that Williams sings in a falsetto singing tone.\n\n\"Come Get It Bae\", which features uncredited guest vocals from Miley Cyrus, is a funk song with playful beat, Lyrically, the song is based around sex and the metaphor \"You want to ride my motorcycle?\" serving as a double entendre for sex."},

Curiously mislabeled as indie rockers, Scouting for Girls are really just the English equivalent of enormously popular, yet critically maligned, mainstream U.S. hitmakers like Train, John Mayer, and even Smash Mouth. The group's detractors, and there are many, will find considerable amounts of ammunition here, though none of it new. The band's penchant for crafting big, hook-filled summer jams that pair generic melodies with painfully obvious rhymes is in full swing, but there's a workmanlike precision to The Light Between Us that demands a little respect. After all, unless you're Paul McCartney, it's hard to apply a substantial amount of passion to the middle of the road. While songs like \"Without You\" and \"Snakes and Ladders\" do feel a little like audio lessons from a Coldplay for Dummies book, the band's sheer exuberance, along with vocalist Roy Stride's versatile pipes, which can go from conversational lad-rock bravado to a soaring falsetto in a matter of seconds, helps to keep things from becoming completely submerged in a sea of mediocrity. At its best, The Light Between Us serves up its forgettable confections in a tidy wrapper, which allows standout cuts like \"Summertime in the City\" and \"Rocky Balboa\" to slide down the listener's throat without injury, but too much of anything can cause a sour stomach, especially cheese."},

It’s a little ways off – it’s not ready to happen right now – but I think next year is going to be a really big year for the Foo Fighters, without question.\"\n\nAccording to lead guitarist Chris Shiflett, Grohl would finish the lyrics just before recording his vocals, the last part of each song. This time the compositions would drift away from \"love letters and confused relationships\" to deal with the feelings Grohl had regarding each city during production.\nOn September 6, 2013, lead guitarist Chris Shiflett posted a photo to his Instagram account that had indicated 13 songs were being recorded for the album. Keyboardist Rami Jaffee has recorded parts for three songs, one of which is entitled \"In The Way.\" Butch Vig, who produced the band's prior album, Wasting Light, confirmed he produced Sonic Highways as well. On July 30, 2014, Vig revealed that the band had finished recording and mixing the new album and it is slated to be released a month after the Sonic Highways TV series. In an August 2014 press release Grohl spoke about the album, saying: \"This album is instantly recognizable as a Foo Fighters record, but there's something deeper and more musical to it. I think that these cities and these people influenced us to stretch out and explore new territory, without losing our ‘sound’.\""},

Self-produced by members of the band along with English hip-hop producer Alexander Grant, known by his moniker Alex Da Kid, the album is set to be released by Interscope Records and Grant's KIDinaKORNER label on February 17, 2015 in the United States. Pre-orders for the album became available on December 15, 2014.\nIn 2012, Imagine Dragons released their debut studio album Night Visions. The album, produced by the band along with Alexander Grant and Brandon Darner, launched the band into international mainstream commercial success, charting within the top ten of 14 national record charts, in addition to charting on eight others. Certified Platinum by seven national music associations, including 2xPlatinum in the United States by the RIAA and 3xPlatinum in Canada by Music Canada, the album was initially met with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006. The album was also nominated for the 2014 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.\n\nThe band released six singles during the Night Visions album cycle in 2012 and 2013, five of which charting on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Radioactive\", a 2013 single, sold more than six million singles in the United States, spending more than 1 year consecutively on the Billboard Hot 100. Peaking at no. 3 on the chart, it also broke the record for the longest run into the top five and is the best-selling rock single on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock tracks in digital history. Billboard listed the band as one of \"2012's Brightest New Stars\" and later \"The Breakout Band of 2013\".\n\nTo further promote the already-successful Night Visions, the band set out on a year-long concert tour beginning in early 2013 and ending in mid-2014, dubbed the \"Night Visions Tour\". The tour spanned for over 170 dates, and visited North America, South America, Europe and Oceania. An additional tour of North America, dubbed the \"Into the Night Tour\", was also executed. The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the Night Visions album cycle, with Night Visions Live, a live album, serving as the last release in the cycle. Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the Night Visions cycle, saying that \"We're always writing on the road,  that second album will come, unless we die at the age of 27 next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it may come\". The band were also inspired greatly by the band's experiences on the Night Visions Tour. Dan Reynolds told New Orleans-based newspaper The Times-Picayune that the world tour had \"a lot of inspiration to be drawn\", and further stating, \"You kind of realize that you’re a lot smaller than you think.\"\n\nThe idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their \"new year's resolution\", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Reynolds told MTV in 2014 that the band wanted to \"put out an album that  really happy with\". He further said that \"we tend to be perfectionists, too hard on ourselves at times, and we don't want to rush anything because we know how we are with things. We don't want to put a record out until we really feel good about it, you know, and who knows how long that will take\".\nReynolds stated to music magazine Rolling Stone that the next album will be \"different\" from Night Visions, and that the band intends the album to be \"stripped back quite a bit\". He added that \"we embraced a lot of hip-hop influences with Night Visions, but I think the next record will be more rock-driven. It’s too early to say, but there is some weird stuff going on in these songs\".\n The creative process for the album began long before the conclusion of the Night Visions cycle. Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour in 2012, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from. The demos had been described by Reynolds as \"definitely different\", but added that \"it’s still Imagine Dragons, but we’ve got a lot of growth and maturing do do as a band. I think  is going to hopefully be a step in the right direction. We’re just trying to create and do what comes out and what feels right\". The band also were self-critical throughout the sessions, with Drummer Daniel Platzman stating that there was \"no room for external pressure\" during the recording of the album.\n\nThe band announced a rest at the end of the Night Visions Tour at Lollapalooza in Sao Paulo, Brazil and complemented saying, \"This is our last show for a while, and had no better place to end this tour\". Preparations for the album began the next day, with the band entering the Studio at the Palms to work on a new album on April 15, 2014. The band marked this occasion with various tweets including a picture of Wayne Sermon at a desk with recording software open."},

The title track remains one of Bowie's best known, a classic story of two lovers who meet at the Berlin Wall.

It was released by Capitol Records on October 18, 2013. While the album was initially planned to be \"darker\" than her previous material, Prism ultimately became a prominently dance-inspired record. The singer worked with several past collaborators, while enlisting new producers and guest vocals. Much of Prism revolves around the themes of living in the present, relationships, and self-empowerment. Critical response to Prism was generally mixed; many reviewers deemed the lyrical content more mature while others considered the album to be more formulaic than her previous material.\n\nThe album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with 286,000 copies sold, becoming Perry's best opening week to date. The album also peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Prism became Perry's fastest-selling album, the second best-selling album in Australia in 2013, and the second best-selling album released by a woman in the United States in 2013. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that Prism was the sixth best-selling album in the world in 2013, the best-selling album in the world in 2013 released by a woman, and labeled Perry \"a global phenomenon.\" It has globally sold 4 million copies as of August 2015. The album's success continued throughout 2014, ranking within the top 10 of the annual charts for 2014 in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and earned Perry a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nThe release of the album was preceded by the release of two singles. \"Roar\" was released on August 10, 2013 as the album's lead single. It became a commercial success and topped the Billboard Hot 100. \"Unconditionally\" debuted on October 16, 2013 as the record's second single and was a moderate commercial success worldwide. In between the release of these two tracks were the releases of promotional singles \"Dark Horse\" on September 17 and \"Walking on Air\" on September 30, 2013. \"Dark Horse\" was released as the album's third single three months later on December 17, 2013, and also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Birthday\" and \"This Is How We Do\" were the fourth and fifth singles, respectively. Prism was further promoted through The Prismatic World Tour."},

It was released worldwide through Bowie's ISO Records label on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday. Bowie died two days after its release. Co-producer Tony Visconti described the album as Bowie's intended swan song and a \"parting gift\" for his fans before his death.\n\nBlackstar was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching the number one spot in a number of countries in the wake of Bowie's death, and becoming Bowie's first and only album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 album chart in the U.S. The album remained at the number one position in the UK charts for three weeks before being replaced by one of Bowie's compilation albums, Best of Bowie.\n\nBowie recorded the album in the midst of an ongoing battle with cancer. His illness was only known by those very close to him and that remained so until the news of his death became public, two days after the album's release. It became apparent immediately after that many lyrics seem to come from a man who knows death is near. Like The Next Day, recording of this album took place in secret at The Magic Shop and Human Worldwide Studios in New York City. Bowie began writing and making demos for songs that appear on Blackstar as soon as sessions for The Next Day concluded. Two songs that appear on Blackstar, \"Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)\" and \"'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore\", were previously released, but were re-recorded for Blackstar, including new saxophone parts played on the latter song by Donny McCaslin (replacing parts Bowie played on the original release). The title of the latter derives from the title 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, a play by John Ford, an English dramatist of the 17th century. McCaslin and the rest of the jazz group recorded their parts in the studio over a period of about one week a month from January to March 2015, and were unaware of Bowie's declining health. The song \"Lazarus\" was included in Bowie's Off-Broadway musical of the same name.\n\nThe music on Blackstar has been characterized as incorporating art rock, jazz, and experimental rock, as well as elements from industrial rock, folk-pop and hip hop. According to producer Tony Visconti, they deliberately attempted \"to avoid rock’n’roll\" while making the album, and he and Bowie had been listening to rapper Kendrick Lamar's 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly during the recording sessions and cited it as an influence. Electronic duo Boards of Canada and experimental hip-hop trio Death Grips have also been cited as influences. Saxophone was the first instrument Bowie learned, and he was a keen listener to jazz in his youth. Both Billboard and CNN noted that Bowie's lyrics seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\"."},

It was released on 20 November 2015, through XL Recordings. Following the release and international success of her second studio album 21 (2011), Adele considered quitting the music industry and going out on a positive note. However, she decided to take a hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered from writer's block and rescheduled studio sessions for a new album, fearing she had lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through 2015.\n\nTitled as a reflection of her life and frame of mind at 25 years old, 25 is a \"make-up record\". The album's lyrical content features themes of Adele \"yearning for her old self, her nostalgia\", and \"melancholia about the passage of time\" according to an interview with Adele by Rolling Stone, as well as themes of motherhood and regret. In contrast to Adele's previous work, the production of 25 incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns, with elements of 1980s R&B and organs. Like 21, Adele collaborated with producer and songwriter Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder, along with new collaborations with Max Martin and Shellback, Greg Kurstin, Danger Mouse, the Smeezingtons, Samuel Dixon, and Tobias Jesso Jr.\n\n25 received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended Adele's vocal performance. The album achieved commercial success by debuting at number one in more than 25 markets and broke first-week sales records in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and United States; in the US, the album sold 3.38 million copies in its first week of release, marking the largest single-week sales for an album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991. 25 eventually became the best-selling album of 2015 in the US and UK market and has sold over 19 million copies worldwide as of February 2016. Many journalists felt that the album impacted the music industry by encouraging the public to return to buying physical albums, instead of downloading or streaming."},

On 1 January 2017, Sheeran officially ended his hiatus by announcing that \"new music\" would be released on 6 January. On 12 January 2017, Sheeran revealed the track list and the release date for the album.\n\nThe album ÷ received mostly positive reviews from critics. Harriet Gibsone of The Guardian gave the album a negative two-star rating out of five, calling it \"no less calculating than his peers at the very top level of pop stardom\". Roisin O'Connor of The Independent gave it a four-star rating, claiming \" leans on little asides from Sheeran's own talent\" and that it was \"astonishing for its sheer ambition alone\". After commenting on the album's \"missteps,\" Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press said that it \"is certain to add listeners, subtract a few weary of his inconsistency, but definitely multiply his bank account,\" and ultimately called Sheeran \"a special talent.\"\n\nThe album sold 232,000 physical and digital copies in the UK in its first day of release without the inclusion of streaming data, more than the sales of Sheeran's previous album x in its first week. The tracks of the album also achieved a total of 56.73 million streams worldwide on Spotify in a single day, breaking the previous record of 29 million for Starboy by The Weeknd in November 2016.

In an interview with Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley in December 2014, bassist Guy Berryman and guitarist Jonny Buckland gave a hint as to the difference between A Head Full of Dreams and its predecessor – Buckland called it the \"night to the day\", comparing the style of Ghost Stories to the expected uplifting theme of A Head Full of Dreams. Frontman Chris Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting. He also stated that it would be something to \"shuffle your feet\" to.\n\nOn 26 September 2015, the band performed at the Global Citizen Festival 2015 in New York City, playing a six-song set, including a new song called \"Amazing Day\".

Perhaps Perry shifted her approach after \"Rise,\" the \"Roar\"-alike written for the 2016 Olympics that she also performed at that year's Democratic National Convention, failed to crack the Top Ten, perhaps she always planned to construct this album with electronic beats and synths, but Witness is so slick with synths it seems slippery. It also feels relentless and a shade desperate. Some of this is due to timing. Arriving on the heels of Prism, a record littered with AAA crossover ballads, the dance-heavy Witness feels like a slide backwards into adolescence, even if the album is filled with songs where Perry attempts to address big cultural issues while walking a musical cutting edge. These conflicting desires surface on a tune as effervescent as \"Chained to the Rhythm\" -- the only track here that could be called that, although \"Pendulum\" comes close -- and a song as somnolent as \"Bigger Than Me,\" the second of two ballads on the record and the one that addresses the fallout of the 2016 presidential election. Despite some sociological broad strokes, Perry generally keeps her focus personal -- and usually romantic, although \"Swish Swish\" plays like a swipe at another superstar -- a decision that, when married to aggressive EDM-pop, erodes whatever adult contemporary progress Perry made with Prism. So, Witness is a conceptual muddle but that incoherence could've been excused if there were hooks in either its grooves or melodies. Instead, Witness is populated with busy, tuneless tracks that seemed designed to pulsate in the background of a regrettable night. Perry's insistence on delving deep into electronic dance doesn't play like a pop visionary charting new directions forward; it seems anxious, as if she can sense her youth -- and perhaps more importantly, her stardom among youth -- slipping away."},

It was released on November 10, 2017, by BMG Rights Management. The album includes reworked versions of the band's previous material with an orchestral arrangement and electronica music elements, in addition to two new songs, thus making it both a studio album and a compilation album. David Campbell was responsible for the arrangement, along with Amy Lee and producer William B. \"Science\" Hunt (no relation to the band's drummer, Will Hunt). In order to promote the new material, Evanescence embarked on the Synthesis Tour, which opened on October 14, 2017, in Las Vegas and will visit cities across the United States and Canada until December.\n\nSince the release of their self-titled third studio album in 2011 and the accompanying world tour (2011–2012), Evanescence took a three-year music hiatus, during which each member pursued their own projects. During that period, the band also parted ways with their long-term record label Wind-up Records. In November 2015, Evanescence made its return to stage, performing at the Ozzfest in Tokyo. At that time, Lee announced that there were no future plans for recording new material with the band and that the group would only tour and rejoin with its fans during through concerts in the following year. She further added that she focused on making music as a solo artist and exploring a side to her different from the one when she worked with Evanescence. In 2016, more dates were added to their tour with concerts taking place in the US.\n\nOn September 13, 2016, the band announced a vinyl box set titled The Ultimate Collection which included all three studio albums, the demo recorded early on in their career and new version of their song \"Even in Death\"; the set was released on February 17, 2017. In October 2016, Lee revealed during an interview with the online magazine Loudwire that \"there is Evanescence in the future\", adding that the band had reunited to re-record some of their earlier material, including tracks from their work before their first studio album Fallen (2003). On December 9, 2016, a compilation album titled Lost Whispers, consisting of B-sides and bonus tracks from the band's three studio albums, was made available for streaming and download on several music platforms.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album and its corresponding title Synthesis were revealed by Lee in a video posted on the group's Facebook page on May 10, 2017. According to her, the title came from the fact that the album is \"the synthesis, the combination, the contrast, the synergy between the organic and the synthetic, also the past and present\". She further noted how the new music would be stripped down, performed by an orchestra and would feature elements of electronica and the \"synthetic world of beats and sounds\". According to her, the process behind the album included the band going through their previous catalog and reworking some of their songs. In addition, two new songs were also recorded for Synthesis. She revealed during a video: \"This is a total passion project for me. There are so many layers in our music underneath the huge drums and guitars. I've always wanted to shine a light on some of the gorgeous David Campbell arrangements and programming elements in our songs, and that idea snowballed into completely re-doing them with full orchestra, not just strings, elaborate programming and experimentation\". Lee further added that the project \"flows like a big, dynamic soundtrack\". The rearrangement of the songs was done by David Campbell who had worked with the band during their previous projects and Evanescence members Lee and William B. Hunt.\n\nThe Synthesis version of \"Bring Me to Life\" is a stripped-down one, as it replaces the drums and the guitars from the original version with a strings arrangement. Its instrumentation is also provided by crashing cymbals, \"tension-building\" timpani drums and includes various electronic elements throughout. Several critics have described its new arrangement as \"dramatic\". Lee has described the song as \"new\" to her again due to the fact that she incorporated musical elements and vocals which she had \"heard in  head\" since its release.\n\n\"Imperfection\", one of the original songs written for the album, is an electronic-symphonic track which features Lee's \"signature belting\".

It is the band's first album in thirteen years, due to creative, personal, and legal issues band members encountered since 2006's 10,000 Days. The album was released on August 30, 2019, to critical acclaim, with reviewers agreeing that the band had successfully refined their established sound.\n\nBackground\nWriting\nIn 2006, Tool released their fourth studio album, 10,000 Days. It topped the US Billboard 200 album chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating more than one million units sold, a month later. The band toured heavily in support of the album, playing more than 200 shows through 2007. After this, frontman Maynard James Keenan mentioned that he saw Tool breaking up in the near future, and focused on his side-project, Puscifer. However, by early 2008, at the 50th Grammy Awards, Keenan announced to MTV that the band would begin writing new material for their fifth studio album \"right away\".\n\nThe band was quiet over the next few years, only with Tool's website announcing that guitarist Adam Jones, bassist Justin Chancellor, and drummer Danny Carey were working on instrumental material while Keenan focused his efforts on Puscifer. The approach was consistent with what the band had done in the past, with Keenan waiting to write vocals and lyrics until instrumentals were completed. In 2012, the band's website was updated again, with the webmaster writing that they had heard instrumental material that had \"sounded like Tool…some of it reminiscent to earlier Tool stuff, with other parts pushing the envelope\" and that they estimated that the album was around half done.\n\nOutside problems slowed progress on the album over the following years. In 2013, it was reported that two separate scooter accidents injured two undisclosed members of the band, eliminating nine days of planned “jamming” time. Carey later revealed himself as one of the involved members, noting that he had been involved in a motorcycle accident that resulted in multiple cracked ribs, which caused him pain that further slowed recording. Keenan summed up the album's progress at the time in a cooking analogy, explaining that \"Basically right now it's a lot of ideas. There's no actual songs…It's still kind of noodles in a big basket. Lots of noodles, just no dishes.\" In 2014, Jones and Carey revealed that complicated legal issues and court battles stemming from a 2007 lawsuit had been slowing down the process as well. The issues stemmed from a lawsuit from a friend who claimed credit for artwork the band had used, but escalated after an insurance company involved sued the band over technicalities, leading to the band then counter-suing the insurance company. The constant court battles and delays, coupled with other life obligations, limited the band's time for working on music, and drained members of their motivation to be creative and write music. At the time, Carey stated that only one song was “pretty much done”, an untitled ten-minute track. In 2015, Jones announced that the legal issues were completely over.\n\nThe four of us are a lot of fucking work, just to get anywhere, oh my god. Everything’s a fucking committee meeting and it always gets shut down.  success. When you get successful, you think you’re right about everything and you’re pretty sure as that individual — ‘I am right and you are wrong, because I’m successful and we’re successful because of me, not because of you.’ It’s not that bad with us, but there’s a dynamic of like, ‘I want this and I’ve always gotten my way and that’s why we’re successful, because I don’t compromise on this or that.’ I’m the same way. I’m totally the same way.\nMaynard James Keenan, on the creative struggles on writing Fear Inoculum.\nWork on the album continued to progress through 2015, albeit \"slowly\", according to Keenan. Jones reported that the band had 20 different song ideas being developed. The band toured some, and debuted a new track, \"Descending\", albeit in a shortened, incomplete form, according to Jones. Jones also reported that instrumentals had been completed and passed on to Keenan to work on, though he hesitated to call any of the work \"done\". While it was reported in early 2016 by the band's webmaster that it was largely just a few shorter songs and interludes that needed finishing, by the end of the year, Chancellor described the band's status as still \"deep into the writing process”. He explained that while main themes and a loose \"skeleton\" had been established, Jones, Carey, and himself were continually creating and reworking new instrumental content. This work on the album continued throughout 2017. At the time, Carey predicted finishing and releasing in mid-2018, while Keenan countered these claims, stating it would likely take longer than that to finish. Jones, Chancellor, and Carey continued to work on the album while Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle in late 2017 to work with Billy Howerdel to record and release their fourth studio album Eat the Elephant in early 2018. By February 2018, Keenan announced that he had received rough music files from the rest of the band members containing instrumentals labeled \"FINAL\" for all but one track on the album in the prior few months, and had since started writing lyrics and vocal melodies.\n\nRecording\nOn March 10, 2018, Tool entered a major recording studio to start recording sessions with producer Joe Barresi, whom they had worked with on 10,000 Days. On May 11, it was reported that all drum parts had been tracked. In September, Keenan announced he had finished recording scratch vocals, but had not started final vocal takes. In January 2019, Keenan announced that he had finished his final vocal recording sessions \"months ago\", but that the album would still likely require lengthy mixing sessions. In the same month, Carey stated that they aimed to release the album in April 2019, though Keenan countered that this was unrealistic, instead pointing to a release between May and July. The band was in the studio with Bob Ludwig in March 2019; Ludwig had also mastered 10,000 Days.\n\nComposition and themes\nThe album consists of seven main tracks of music, and a run time just short of 80 minutes, the maximum runtime of CDs. The digital version of the album contains three short interlude tracks, stemming from Carey’s scrapped plan to have the album be entirely one long song. Jones and Carey described the songs as lengthy, but containing multiple movements within each track. The concept of seven is a recurring theme of the album both musically and conceptually; Chancellor and Jones wrote guitar riffs in unusual time signatures related to the number seven, while Keenan introduced ideas related to seven as well. Future music videos will also cover the theme. The album also explores the concept of growing \"older and wiser\". Keenan explained that the album covers the idea of \"embracing where we are right now, acknowledging where we've come from and some of the things we've gone through.\" Keenan also advised that patience and multiple listens were required in understanding the album, comparing it to a slowly developing movie. Jones described it as very different from their prior album (10,000 Days). Music critics and journalists have described the album as progressive rock, progressive metal, and alternative metal."},

Ideal for fans of late-era Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, and Blossoms, Let's Go Sunshine isn't as cheerful as the title suggests: a mostly tame affair packed with patient groovers and some lush production, this is a full-album experience with a few punchy standouts. Forgoing the youthful cheek that defined their earlier releases, Sunshine can be a bit of a slog: at 15 tracks, it gets bogged down by the contemplative exercises, but resuscitated by the festival-sized anthems punctuated throughout. Coming closest to the excitement of past hits like \"Junk of the Heart\" and \"Bad Habit,\" the rousing \"Kids,\" \"Pamela,\" and \"Four Leaf Clover\" escalate Sunshine to the summer festival mainstage with jerky rhythms and catchy choruses. Midtempo funk-groovers \"All the Time\" and \"Chicken Bone\" strut like Bowie, while the shimmering \"Tesco Disco\" and \"Initials for Gainsbourg\" draw from a similar psychedelic pool. Taken piecemeal, there's enough variety to excite and warrant repeat listens; however, pacing suffers when the momentum is cut by otherwise pleasant tracks like \"Fractured and Dazed\" and \"Picture Frame.\" These issues aside, Let's Go Sunshine is a mature progression for the Kooks, one that points in the right direction for the band's evolution."},
